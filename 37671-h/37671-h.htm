  <h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <p class="introduction"><span class="first-letter">A</span>T the present moment the
  Canal Zone of the Isthmus of Panama is the most interesting place in the world. Here is
  gathered an army of 40,000 men engaged in the epoch-making work of uniting the Atlantic
  and Pacific Oceans, and here is the greatest collection of machinery ever massed for
  the accomplishment of one undertaking.</p>

  <p>If the present rate of progress continue unchecked, the Canal, it is calculated,
  will be opened in 1915. Then will that Isthmus, which has hitherto been a barrier
  between two oceans but has failed to act as a bridge between two continents, be pierced
  by a waterway capable of floating the largest ships now built or building. Then will
  the Pacific coasts of the Americas be accessible from<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> ports on both sides of the Atlantic without
  the necessity of a voyage by the Straits of Magellan. Then will the distance from New
  York to San Francisco be shortened by 8,400 and that from Liverpool by 6,000 miles; the
  distance from New York to South American ports will be shortened by an average of 5,000
  and that from Liverpool to these ports by an average of 2,600 miles: then for the first
  time Yokohama on the north and Sydney on the south will be brought nearer to New York
  than to Liverpool or Antwerp, and then will New Orleans and the ports on the Mexican
  Gulf be brought nearer than New York, by sea, to San Francisco, South America beyond
  Pernambuco, Australia, and Japan.</p>

  <p>No one who cares to know the greater things which are shaping the world can now
  afford to be ignorant of what is happening on the Isthmus of Panama. In the former days
  of unstable companies the student of affairs might decline to occupy himself in the
  study of an undertaking of which the fruition was doubtful. Now, however, that
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>the Government
  of a great nation have put their hands to the plough the furrow will be driven through.
  The United States have acquired complete ownership and control of the Canal and of a
  strip of land five miles wide on either side, called the Canal Zone. The small State of
  Panama, in which this zone is situate, has placed itself under the protection of the
  United States. The Government of Great Britain has by a treaty ratified in 1901 waived
  the treaty right which it formerly enjoyed to share with the United States the control
  of any trans-Isthmian canal. The Isthmus has been freed from those pestilences which
  were the greatest obstacles to human effort, and the engineering difficulties are no
  longer beyond the scope of modern science.</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>Having first visited the Canal works at the beginning of 1907, I decided to make
  upon the spot a careful examination of the whole undertaking. For this purpose I
  visited Washington and made application through the proper channel to the
  Depart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ment of
  State, which kindly consented to further the inquiry. A set of the published documents
  was supplied to me, and I proceeded from New York to the Isthmus by the R.M.S.P.
  <i>Magdalena</i>, arriving at Colon April 12, 1908. Here Colonel Goethals, chairman of
  the Isthmian Canal Commission, provided me with a letter to those concerned to furnish
  all information, and proposed that I should make my way about unattended and pursue my
  inquiries independently. I was thus enabled to converse with perfect freedom with the
  rank and file, while drawing freely on the special information possessed only by the
  heads of departments.</p>

  <p>For the benefit of readers in England I may explain that these circumstances were to
  me of especial importance on account of the doubts thrown by American writers, and also
  by Americans of repute in conversation, upon the reliability of official and other
  information supplied to the American public on the burning topic of the Isthmus. As an
  Englishman, and therefore standing outside American party politics, and as a
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>scientific
  student not engaged in commerce or political life, I came to the study of the subject
  without prepossessions. This at least was my happy state when I arrived in Washington
  in March last. When I left for the Canal Zone a month later I was filled with gloomy
  forebodings that I might after all find a rotten state of affairs on the Isthmus. It
  was with intense relief that I found that I had what is called in America "an honest
  proposition" to deal with. As my doubts hitherto had been due to the patriotic anxiety
  of their compatriots, I am sure Colonel Goethals and his colleagues will forgive me for
  this frank statement of my difficulties and their solution.</p>

  <p>Any Englishman, accustomed to see the work of our own soldiers and civil servants in
  the Crown Colonies or in Egypt, would recognise in the officers of the corps of
  Engineers and of the Army Medical Corps who are in charge of the Canal Zone men of a
  like high standard of duty. As this account is written not only for my own countrymen
  but also for readers on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
  22]</a></span>other side of the Atlantic, I should be glad, if it be possible, to
  convince of my own <i>bona-fides</i> those anxious patriots who find it difficult to
  believe any good report from Panama. It may tend in this direction to state that I
  travelled and sojourned at my own charges, and that I went out on an independent
  inquiry. That I had promised to give an account of the Canal works to my brother
  geographers in London was my only undertaking, and the acceptance of a free pass on the
  Panama Railway my only financial obligation either in Washington or on the Isthmus.</p>

  <p>In order properly to understand the present and future of the Canal undertaking, it
  is necessary to give a short account of the history of Isthmian communication, for the
  conditions which now face the American Government and the Commission are not solely due
  to present physical causes, but also to previous events.</p>

  <h5>HISTORICAL REVIEW</h5>

  <p class="introduction"><span class="first-letter">T</span>HE conquest of
  Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 completed their capture of the trade routes
  between Western Europe and the East Indies. The East Indian trade had long been a
  source of great enrichment to European merchants. It was especially suited to the
  restricted carrying power of those times, the products (such as pepper) being small in
  bulk and high in price. The maritime nations therefore sought sea routes to the Indies
  in pursuit of this trade, and it was Columbus himself, in his efforts to open up a
  western route to the Indies and China, who discovered the Bay of Limon in 1497. He and
  his successors sought for a strait or channel <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26"
  id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>which should open the way to the East Indies. Cortes
  sought for the strait in Mexico. Others sought as far north as the St. Lawrence, which
  was supposed to afford a route to China. No opening could, however, be found nearer to
  the Equator than the Straits of Magellan (1520), and the hopes of a short route
  westward to the Indies were disappointed. An Isthmian canal was talked of even in the
  days of Charles V. of Spain to open the route to the East Indies. In those days of
  small vessels, the river channels would have served for a great part of the traverse,
  so that the scheme was not so wild as it may seem.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The purpose, therefore, of the first proposal for piercing the Isthmus was for
  shortening the distance to the Indies and China. The discovery of the nearer riches of
  Peru, however, illustrated the fact that the Isthmian barrier has its uses as well as
  its inconveniences. Porto Bello and Panama were fortified, ships were launched from the
  latter port for the Peruvian traffic, the treasure was carried across the Isthmus under
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>escort and
  shipped to Spain. The treasure-ships, indeed, were liable to attack on the Caribbean,
  but the Isthmian barrier proved an important safeguard to the Peruvian possessions of
  Spain.</p>

  <p>In the next century, the seventeenth, the importance of the Isthmian land route
  declined, owing to the fact that Spain was no longer able to secure even moderate
  safety for her ships on the Caribbean. In the present days, when the importance of
  naval power is so well understood, it is hardly necessary to enlarge upon the
  significance of this fact, and its bearing upon the problems presented by the Panama
  route to-day. The project of an Isthmian canal for the purpose of trade between Europe
  and Asia continued to be agitated, but the inducements were inadequate to overcome the
  obstacles.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

  <p>In the middle of the nineteenth century, for the second time, it was the need of
  improved communication between the east and west of the American Continent which
  provided a sufficient inducement to improve the Isthmian route.</p>

  <p>At this time the Government of the United States were much occupied with projects of
  trans-Isthmian communication, particularly by canal, not with a view to Transpacific
  commerce, but with the object of improved communication between the east and west of
  their own territory.</p>

  <p>In 1846 a treaty was made with the State of New Grenada (afterwards Colombia) with a
  view to providing facilities for transport in the war between the United States and
  Mexico. In its most important provision it is similar to the present treaty between the
  United States and the new Republic of Panama, viz., the United States guarantee the
  sovereignty of the State in question over the Isthmian territory. Hence the Isthmus was
  thus early constituted a Protectorate of the United States.</p>

  <p>But at this time it was generally thought that Lake Nicaragua provided the best
  route for a trans-Isthmian canal.</p>

  <p>The Pacific seaboard having recently acquired importance to the United States, the
  Government desired to further the canal <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
  "Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>project on that account. The only practicable Atlantic
  terminal of a Nicaraguan canal lay within territory over which Great Britain had long
  exercised control. Further, the Pacific Coast of Canada had recently acquired
  importance to the eastern provinces and to the home country, and access thereto was
  extremely difficult. The outcome of these circumstances was the conclusion in 1850 of
  the celebrated Clayton-Bulwer treaty between the United States and Great Britain, which
  was duly ratified by Congress. By this instrument it was agreed that neither Government
  should ever obtain or maintain for itself any exclusive control of any canal connecting
  the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, nor erect fortifications commanding the same.</p>

  <p>This treaty remained in force until 1901, and I shall have to refer to it again.
  Meanwhile the great rush of gold-seekers to California had supplied the needful
  stimulus to a scheme, already mooted, of an Isthmian railway terminating at Panama. In
  spite of the enormous difficulties entailed by the pestilential climate, the
  undertaking was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
  30]</a></span>completed in 1855. This achievement, originating in New York, was the
  work of W.H. Aspinwall, Henry Chauncey, and John L. Stephens.</p>

  <p>It was undertaken independently of any canal scheme, but it exercised a profound
  effect upon the fate of subsequent schemes. The facilities which the railway afforded
  determined de Lesseps's choice of route, and de Lesseps ploughed so deeply that those
  who came after him have found themselves constrained to follow his furrow. The "New
  World" is in fact no longer new, and its statesmen now have to solve problems
  presenting historical as well as physical factors.</p>

  <p>The American Civil War interrupted the prosecution of canal schemes, but the
  examination of routes was recommenced by the United States Government in 1866, a
  Commission finally reporting in 1876<sup>[1]</sup> in favour of the Nicaraguan
  route.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[1]</sup> The report, however, was not published until 1879.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In 1869 the Suez Canal was opened for traffic. Immediately, the route by Panama
  ceased to be the shortest from Europe to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id=
  "Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>any part of the East Indies. The importance of that route
  to Asia was thus greatly reduced as far as Europe was concerned, but, relatively, its
  importance to the United States was increased, for the Suez Canal does not shorten the
  Asiatic voyage from New York, Boston, or New Orleans to the same extent as it does for
  European ports.</p>

  <p>The Old World had been severed into halves by the enterprise of one man, and that
  man no potentate, but merely one possessing the gift of persuasion. By his achievement,
  which was immediately crowned by financial success, Ferdinand de Lesseps suddenly
  became possessed of powers such as are not always at the disposal of the Governments
  even of great countries. He decided himself to sever the barrier between the Atlantic
  and Pacific Oceans, convened a "Congress" at Paris in 1879, and inaugurated in 1881 the
  <i>Compagnie Universelle du Canal Inter-oc&eacute;anique de Panama</i>. He had decided
  to adopt the Panama route on account of the facilities afforded by the railway. The
  money was mainly subscribed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
  32]</a></span>in France. The American railway company was bought out at the enormous
  price of $25,500,000, and in the course of the next eight years a large part of the
  work required for a tide-level canal was well executed on sound lines by the genius of
  the French, who are excelled by none in the arts of the civil engineer. The exact
  proportion which the French work bears to that since accomplished by the American
  Government will be shown later. The engineers now on the Isthmus are full of praise for
  the work of the French engineers, and their wonder daily grows both at its quantity and
  its ingenuity. It is only those at a distance, or ill-informed, who have belittled
  these achievements. Unfortunately, the French engineers were not properly supported. De
  Lesseps, if he were ever a practical man, had certainly ceased to be so since his first
  great success. A practical man is one who counts the cost of everything he is about to
  do. De Lesseps no longer counted cost. He had become as one believing in his star. His
  actions remind <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
  33]</a></span>us of those of some of the great conquerors whose early successes have
  led them to undertake impossible campaigns. The question has been discussed if any
  human character can stand more than a certain share of success and yet retain a sound
  judgment. Certainly the character of de Lesseps was not equal to the strain. The
  expenditure was awful&mdash;$300,000,000 in eight years, <i>i.e.</i>, more than three
  times the sum for which the Suez Canal was constructed. The Company went into
  liquidation in 1889. Much had been embezzled. Much, it is said, had been spent in
  purchasing the silence of voices which would otherwise have been raised against a
  Europeanised canal.</p>

  <p>The affairs of the Company were taken over by the New Panama Canal Company, who
  continued to administer the railway, and, with small means, did excellent work for the
  next twelve years in keeping the machinery and the works from deterioration, in
  excavations at the summit, and above all in extending the scientific examination of
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>the country so
  as to obtain much-needed data for the construction of the high-level canal which was
  now proposed in place of de Lesseps's project of a tide-level waterway.</p>

  <p>In 1869 President Grant, in a message to Congress, had recommended the construction
  of an Isthmian canal under the sole control of the United States, and popular opinion
  since that time, if not before, has always strongly held that if a canal be made it
  should be exclusively under that control. It was not the least of de Lesseps's
  imprudences that he proceeded with his project in spite of warnings on this matter. In
  1898 an event occurred which made the American nation feel that an Isthmian canal was
  necessary, and that it must be under their exclusive control. At the outset of the war
  with Spain, the <i>Oregon</i>, one of the best of America's small fleet of battleships
  (we write of ten years since), was lying in the Pacific. She had to steam more than
  13,000 miles to reach Key West, and the whole nation was in a state of nervous
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>tension for many
  weeks pending her junction with the main fleet.</p>

  <p>It seemed at the time that the Panama route could hardly be obtained for a canal
  under purely American control, and a further investigation of the Nicaraguan route was
  ordered&mdash;that route which had been preferred by the American experts before de
  Lesseps intervened. The New Panama Canal Company had by this time brought their labours
  to the point where it seemed practicable to appeal to the investing public of the world
  for funds to construct a high-level Panama canal. To do this in the face of a
  Nicaraguan canal, undertaken as a national affair by the United States, would have been
  hopeless: they therefore laid their detailed plans before President McKinley. A
  Commission was accordingly appointed by Congress to inquire into the best route for an
  Isthmian canal "under the control, management, and ownership of the United
  States."<sup>[2]</sup> The report was presented to Congress on December 4, 1901, rather
  more than two years later, and is a document of great historical and scientific
  interest. The quarto volume of 688 pages is accompanied by a portfolio of 86 maps,
  plans, and panoramic views. The last of these, showing the mountainous skyline of the
  Isthmus east of Colon, with altitudes marked, illustrates in a striking manner the
  conclusion of the Commission that the San Blas route, or any route east of Colon, would
  involve a ship tunnel. These routes are dismissed as impracticable on account of the
  altitude of the divide. The Nicaraguan and Panamanian are found to be the only
  practicable routes, and the details of both are fully discussed. The high-level canal
  was preferred by the Commission to the sea-level at Panama, and on the Nicaraguan route
  only a high-level canal is possible, so that in this respect the two routes were
  considered to be on a par.</p>

  <p>The relative advantages of the two routes are carefully set out in the report, the
  general tenor of which is favourable to that by Panama. Nevertheless, the Commission
  re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>commend that
  the Nicaraguan route be adopted, on account of the excessive valuation which, they
  state, was placed by the New Panama Canal Company on their works and property. The
  value of these, including the Panama Railway, was estimated by the Commission at
  $40,000,000. The New Panama Canal Company, learning that the Commission had thus
  reported, cabled an offer to sell at this price, and the Commission accordingly sent in
  a supplementary report in favour of the Panama route. By June 28, 1902, the "Spooner"
  Act had been passed and ratified, authorising the President to purchase the canal works
  at this price, and to acquire from the Republic of Colombia the necessary rights for
  the control of a Panama canal, then to be constructed; but in the event of his not
  being able to acquire such control, then to proceed with the Nicaraguan project.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, by the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, ratified by the Senate December 16, 1901,
  Great Britain had waived the right of joint control of any Isthmian canal which she
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>had held since
  the ratification of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty in 1850. It remained therefore only to
  negotiate a treaty with Colombia. The treaty of 1846 with New Grenada afforded a
  precedent as far as the question of control was concerned, and the negotiations appear
  to have been related mainly to the question of price. A treaty was negotiated by
  officials of the two Republics, by which the United States was to pay a sum of
  $10,000,000 to Colombia, and after nine years an annual sum of $100,000. This was
  confirmed by Congress but rejected by the Colombian Senate, and negotiations came to an
  end with the adjournment of that body, October 31, 1903.</p>

  <p>Three days later the Province of Panama renounced its allegiance to Colombia.</p>

  <p>Another three days, and the independence of the New Republic was recognised and
  guaranteed by the United States.</p>

  <p>In less than a fortnight afterwards a treaty was signed at Washington by which the
  United States acquired complete ownership and control of the proposed canal for the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>sum of
  $10,000,000 and an annual payment of $250,000, to commence nine years afterwards. This
  treaty was ratified at Panama December 2, 1903, and by the United States Senate
  February 23, 1904.</p>

  <p>One significant point must be mentioned with reference to the Panamanian revolution.
  The inability of Colombia to make an effective effort to assert its power on the
  Isthmus was due to naval weakness in the absence of communication by land. No army
  could march through the tropical forests which still isolate the Canal Zone from South
  America, and control at Colon and Panama still depends upon sea power.</p>

  <p>Thus, at last, the United States owns and controls its Canal Zone. We will now state
  precisely the position in which that nation stands in reference to this matter, and
  then we may leave the work of the diplomats to consider the task of the engineers.</p>

  <p class="c11">The National Status of the Canal.</p>

  <p>The position which will be held by the United States in relation to other Powers
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>is foreshown in
  the Hay-Pauncefote treaty with Great Britain and in Article XXIII. of the treaty with
  Panama. The Hay-Pauncefote treaty is in supersession of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. The
  latter stipulated that no fortifications should be erected controlling the Canal. In
  the Hay-Pauncefote treaty this clause is omitted. On the other hand, it is stated in
  Article III., &sect; 2, that "the Canal shall never be blockaded, nor shall any right
  of war be exercised nor any act of hostility be committed within it." Hence, the reader
  may have remained in doubt whether the United States Government had intended to reserve
  to themselves the right to fortify. However, the terms of the subsequent treaty with
  the Republic of Panama answer this question, for after stating in Article XVIII. that
  the Canal shall be opened in accordance with all the stipulations of the treaty of 1901
  with Great Britain, Article XXIII. states that "the United States shall have the right
  to establish fortifications."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, such fortifications <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id=
  "Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>are to be constructed, and the plan of the Canal has been
  adjusted to the requirements of military defence.</p>

  <p>There have been, among public men in the United States, two schools of thought on
  the vital question of the defence of the Canal. One school has held that the best
  safeguard was to be obtained by leaving the Canal unfortified (as is the case with the
  Suez Canal), and by the establishment of a general Convention, by which all the Powers,
  including the United States, should bind themselves to respect the neutrality of the
  Canal and leave it inviolate. Other public men preferred forts, guardships, and a
  garrison. The general public in the United States, on the other hand, appears to have
  unanimously held that an international guarantee would be ineffectual and, moreover,
  derogatory. As we have seen, the popular view has prevailed, but traces of the
  antagonistic and incompatible notion of internationalisation remain in the language of
  the treaties. This is not surprising when we recollect that the first draft of the
  Hay-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Pauncefote
  treaty was drawn up with a view to neutralisation, according to the precedents afforded
  by the Suez Canal. Thus we find that Article III. commences with the words: "The United
  States adopts as the basis of the neutralisation of the Canal ..."; and in Article
  XVIII. of the treaty with Panama we find: "The Canal when constructed, and the
  entrances thereto, shall be neutral in perpetuity...."</p>

  </div>

  <p>What then are we to understand by the term "neutral" as applied to the Panama Canal
  in war time? I suppose the meaning to be that if there be a war to which the United
  States is not a party, the Canal will be used by belligerents in exactly the same way
  as was the Suez Canal, <i>e.g.</i>, in the Russo-Japanese War, and that the Government
  of the United States has pledged itself to see that such neutrality is preserved. But
  if there be a war in which the United States is a party, the circumstances of
  fortification and operation by the United States in fact render it impossible for the
  other belligerent to use the Canal, and are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
  "Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>intended<sup>[3]</sup> to have that effect. This being so,
  the United States is preparing to defend the Canal from attack. Thus it is important to
  the proper understanding of the undertaking on which the United States Government has
  embarked that we should clearly realise that the Canal is only neutral in a restricted
  sense.</p>

  <p>The commercial status of the Canal, however, is similar to that of Suez, in that by
  Article III., &sect; 1, of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, "The Canal shall be free and
  open<sup>[4]</sup> to the vessels ... of all nations ... on terms of entire equality,
  so that there shall be no discrimination against any such nation, or its citizens or
  subjects, in respect of the conditions or charges of traffic, or otherwise."</p>

  <h5>ON THE CANAL AS IT IS TO BE</h5>

  <p class="introduction"><span class="first-letter">B</span>ETWEEN Colon and Panama the
  American Isthmus is about 36 miles across as the crow flies, and is therefore nearly,
  though not quite, at its narrowest. In this portion of its sinuous course both coasts
  trend north of east and Panama lies nearly south-east of Colon. The Isthmus in general
  is a very confused mass of hills and mountains. It is crossed by no transverse trench
  (such as sometimes occurs in mountainous regions), neither by the trough provided by
  down-folded strata, nor the rift valley produced by fracture and foundering of rock. A
  low-level transverse can only be found by following up the course of a river, crossing
  the divide, and following the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg
  48]</a></span>course of another river downwards to the other ocean. From the vicinity
  of Colon, by following up the valley of the River Chagres, we are led in precisely the
  required direction, <i>i.e.</i>, directly towards the Pacific, for nearly two-thirds of
  the way. The distance from the head of Limon Bay, following the curves of the valley,
  is 26 miles to this place, Obispo, and for the greater part of the distance the river
  flows in a broad valley of deep alluvial deposits.</p>

  <div class="figcenter c2">
    <img src="images/48a.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt=""
    title="" /> <span class="caption">FRENCH DREDGER LAID

    "" title=
    "" /> <span class="caption">FRENCH
    TRUCKS PARTLY COVERED WITH FOREST GROWTH.</span>
  </div>

  <p>At the point mentioned, the Chagres abruptly changes its course, and, if followed
  towards its source, will be found to be flowing from north-east to south-west.
  Moreover, it is now confined to a narrow valley, with steep hills of rocky substance on
  either side, and its gradient becomes much greater than hitherto. The course of the
  Canal cannot therefore follow the Chagres valley further. Fortunately, the valley has
  led us not only a long distance towards the Pacific, but to a place where the dividing
  ridge only attains an elevation of about 300 feet above sea-level. Striking from Obispo
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>straight for the
  Bay of Panama, we come in 9 miles to the low alluvial plain of the Rio Grande, which
  leads straight to the sea in another 6 miles. Thus, from shore to shore, the course of
  the Canal along this route is 41 miles; but to reach deep water 4-1/2 miles must be
  dredged beneath the sea at either end, so that the total length of the artificial
  waterway is 50 miles. Of the land-course less than a quarter, or about 9 miles, is hill
  country, and most of this is less than 200 feet above the sea. The United States has
  been committed to this route by the long chain of circumstances already narrated.</p>

  <p>Whatever type of canal was to be constructed along this route, there were certain
  excavations which must necessarily be done. These were, firstly, dredging the sea
  channels, and secondly, making a cut through the solid rocks of the divide. Thus,
  although de Lesseps started operations upon inadequate data, yet most of the work done
  by the first Panama Canal Company is available, either for the tide-level canal
  proposed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>by de
  Lesseps or for the 85-foot-level canal now being made by the United States. Similarly,
  the New Panama Canal Company, although hampered by many uncertainties, continued to
  work at the Culebra Cut, as it is called, that is to say, the trench through the rocky
  hills which separate the alluvial valleys of the Chagres and the Rio Grande.</p>

  <p>Thus the works taken over by the United States in 1904 were available for any type
  of canal, and the decision to adopt the 85-foot-level was not taken until 1906. Even
  now, or in April, 1908, at the time of my visit, when so much work has been done upon
  the locks, many of the rank and file of the employees still cherish the hope of a
  tide-level canal, and there are not wanting well-informed people, both on the Isthmus
  and in the States, who, while accepting the high-level scheme as inevitable, regard a
  tide-level canal as essentially a better thing.</p>

  <p>Let us resume our description of the Isthmus, in order that we may be in a
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>position to
  understand the conditions with which the engineers have to deal. The practicability of
  the Panama route is due to the fact that rivers have already done a great part of the
  excavation, and if desert conditions had supervened&mdash;if there were, as at Suez,
  practically no rainfall&mdash;the construction of a tide-level canal would be simply
  the excavation of a trench in dry material, which would be filled by the inflowing
  waters of the sea. A tidal lock being added to regulate the ebb and flow at Panama (for
  the Atlantic side is tideless), the canal would be complete.</p>

  <p>But as things actually are, the rainfall on the Isthmus is very heavy, particularly
  on the Atlantic side, where it reaches 140 inches<sup>[5]</sup> per annum, and the
  rivers have at all times considerable bodies of water, and during the rainy season
  (commencing in May) are subject to sudden and violent freshets. The Chagres at Gamboa
  has been known to rise 35-1/2 feet in 24 hours.<sup>[6]</sup> Suppose then <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>that a tide-level trench
  were suddenly formed across the Isthmus, as by a convulsion of nature. We should then
  see the rivers pouring into this fjord in a number of cascades of various height. Of
  these the greatest would be the Chagres cascade, entering from the east near Gamboa and
  Obispo. The height of the waterfall would be 46 feet in the driest season and as much
  as 80 feet in occasional floods.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

  <p>In order therefore to make a tide-level canal, some means must be found for
  disposing of the waters of the Chagres and other rivers. De Lesseps's tide-level
  project was rather an aspiration than a plan. He proposed to conduct the waters of the
  Chagres to the sea by other channels. The magnitude of this task would be scarcely less
  than that of cutting the Canal itself. The other rivers on both sides of the Canal
  would likewise require diversion channels, so that the final result would be roughly
  the formation of three channels, of which the centre one would be for navigation. The
  Board of Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
  53]</a></span>suiting Engineers summoned by President Roosevelt in 1905 to advise the
  Isthmian Canal Commission recommended, in a majority report, a tide-level canal as
  practicable and best fulfilling the national requirements, defined by the Spooner Act
  of 1902. But whereas they had detailed schemes for high-level canals before them, they
  were in the matter of the sea-level project at the disadvantage of having to act in a
  constructive capacity and elaborate the details of a scheme before they could criticise
  it. Moreover, five of the eight who constituted the majority were European engineers,
  who returned to their duties as soon as the report was drafted. The report of the
  minority in favour of the 85-foot-level scheme having been adopted by Congress in 1906,
  all available engineering talent has for the last two years been devoted to improving
  the details of this scheme. The tide-level project of the majority of the Board has had
  no such advantage, and the difficulty of estimating the relative advantages of the two
  schemes is therefore all the greater.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

  <p>Both schemes depend for their success upon the security of dams.</p>

  <p>The tide-level scheme has a dam at Gamboa, near Obispo, thus making a lake of the
  upper waters of the Chagres, whose surface would be 200 feet above
  sea-level.<sup>[8]</sup> The floodwater would partly be accommodated in the lake by
  reason of the great height of the dam above low-water stage, and partly by running the
  excess into the Canal, by which it would escape to the sea, generating currents which
  the Board calculated would not attain an injurious velocity.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[8]</sup> Report, Board of Consulting Engineers, p. 205.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Streams entering the Chagres in its lower reaches would be dammed back or
  diverted&mdash;a considerable, but not momentous, undertaking. The three great
  objections to the scheme appeared to be:&mdash;</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The extra cost, and above all the extra time, required to complete the immensely
    greater quantity of excavation required for the last 85 feet;</li>

    <li>The fact that the artificial lake was to be above the Canal, so that, if the dam
    burst, the Canal might be ruined; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id=
    "Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></li>

    <li>That the velocity of currents in the Canal due to discharge of the surplus waters
    might perhaps be a serious drawback to navigation in a narrow channel.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>It will be seen presently that the second disadvantage is offset by corresponding
  disadvantages in the dam required for the high-level canal.</p>

  <p>As for the cost, that has always been an unknown quantity, and, I think, has always
  been a secondary consideration. The fear of undue delay seems to have been the
  principal deciding factor in favour of the high-level scheme. Rival expert opinions
  that the majority of the Board of Engineers had under-estimated the time required for
  the tide-level canal were adopted by those in authority, and mainly on this account, I
  think, the high-level scheme became law.</p>

  <p>Since visiting the Isthmus a second time, and inspecting the work in the great Cut
  between Empire and Paraiso, it has seemed to me that there is an objection to the
  tide-level project which did not fully appear in <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the early stages of the work, viz., that the
  behaviour of the rock might involve the engineers in ever-increasing difficulties as
  the depths increased. The opinion which had been held by many that the difficulties
  would diminish with the depth did not seem to me to be justified up to that time.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Next let us see what are the special difficulties of the high-level project.</p>

  <p>This also depends for its success mainly on the efficacy of one dam, which is now
  being made at Gatun. It will hold up the waters not only of the Chagres but of its
  tributaries, to a level of 85 feet above mean tide, and the area of the lake thus to be
  formed is shown on the map. The Chagres will be ponded back far above the point where
  it enters the Canal, and thus will be effectually tamed. The flood-waters will be
  spread over an area of about 164 square miles&mdash;for Lake Gatun will be twice the
  size of Lago Maggiore and about four-fifths that of the Lake of Geneva,<sup>[9]</sup>
  and ships, in the ample waterway, will not be troubled by currents.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[9]</sup> The size, in fact, will not differ greatly from that of the
    principal basin of the Lake of Geneva, all above the <i>petit lac</i>, or narrow part
    at the Geneva end. A good idea of this area is obtained by recalling the well-known

  <p>A flight of three locks at Gatun will raise ships to the level of this lake in
  coming from the Atlantic, and one lock at Pedro Miguel and two at Milaflores will lower
  them to the level of the Pacific.</p>

  <p>It has been claimed that if the Gatun dam burst the consequences would be less
  disastrous than if the Gamboa dam burst, but there is in reality little to choose
  between the two catastrophes.</p>

  <p>The great blot on the high-level scheme is that the great Gatun dam is not founded
  on solid rock. The Gamboa dam of the tide-level project would have been founded
  throughout on hard rock, from which it could have been built up of masonry so that the
  structure should be part and parcel of the rocky framework of the globe itself. The
  Gatun dam as recommended in the minority report, on the other hand, was <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>designed to consist
  essentially of a mass of earth dumped upon an alluvial plain so as to fill up a gap of
  2,000 yards between two ranges of hills, the gap through which the Chagres escapes to
  the Atlantic. Thus the Gatun lake was to be held up as a glacier lake is held by a
  moraine blocking a valley.</p>

  <p>We shall presently describe the high-level canal as it is to be, from which it will
  be seen that it will provide a magnificent waterway, but before concluding the present
  section I must mention the special point in which it will be inferior to a tide-level
  canal. This is for purposes of defence. A fortress has to be preserved from capture,
  but not from damage. The locks, however, must be preserved from serious damage, which
  demands far more elaborate protection. Such protection, moreover, has to be provided at
  two positions (Gatun and Milaflores) about 30 miles apart.</p>

  <p class="c11">The High-level Canal as it is to be.</p>

  <p>The Spooner Act, the law under which the Canal is being constructed, enacts that
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>it shall be "of
  sufficient capacity and depth as shall afford convenient passage for vessels of the
  largest tonnage and greatest draft now in use, and such as may reasonably be
  expected."</p>

  <p>Accordingly the following dimensions have been selected:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. A minimum depth of 41 feet.</p>

  <p>The Suez Canal has a depth of 31 feet<sup>[10]</sup> admitting of the passage of
  ships with a draft of 27 feet.<sup>[11]</sup> The channel of this canal is now being
  deepened, so that by 1915 it is hoped that a depth of 36 feet<sup>[12]</sup> will be
  obtained. The Kiel Canal has a depth of 30 feet. The average draft of the Cunard s.s.
  <i>Mauretania</i>, the largest ship now afloat, is about 32 feet, but she is stated to
  draw, when fully laden, about 37 feet, and there are comparatively few harbours in the
  world which she could enter fully loaded.</p>

  <p>The minimum bottom width, or width at a depth of 31 feet, in the Suez Canal is 108
  feet.</p>

  <p>3. Each lock will have a usable length of 1,000 feet and a width of 110 feet.</p>

  <p>The locks of the Kiel Canal have an available length of 492 feet and width of 82
  feet.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mauretania</i> has a length of 790 feet and beam of 88 feet.</p>

  <p>4. The minimum radius of the curves is 5,577 feet (1,700 metres).<sup>[14]</sup>
  This curve, however, does not come in the Culebra Cut, where the bottom width is to be
  200 feet, but north of Bas Obispo, where the bottom width is 500 feet. Most of the
  curves have a radius of 9,842 feet (3,000 metres).</p>

    that this figure is subject to slight modification.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the Suez Canal,<sup>[15]</sup> outside Lake Timsah, there are five curves with a
  radius of 2,000 metres, or a little more, which are being enlarged to 2,500 metres
  (8,202 feet). The usual bottom width in these curves was 184 feet, but this is being
  increased to about 230 feet. The Kiel Canal has four curves with a radius of 1,000
  metres (3,284 feet).</p>

  <p>A reference to the accompanying plan (<i>vide</i> Map, end of volume) of the Panama
  Canal will show that most of the curves are situate in Gatun lake, where the width of
  the canal proper is large, and where the spread of shallower waters secures better
  steerage.</p>

  <p>Thus the high-level Canal is not only deep and wide, but also much freer from
  troublesome curves than might be supposed from a casual inspection of its course. The
  details of the bottom width of the high-level Canal in its different parts are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  being shallow, the deep water where a battleship can freely navigate or manoeuvre lies
  outside a line joining Colon Lighthouse with Toro Point, and at a distance of 7-1/2
  miles from Gatun locks. From this distance the lock-excavation can now be plainly
  discerned from the deck of a ship without the aid of a glass. Here, when the Canal is
  complete, a ship will enter the buoyed channel of the submarine portion of the Canal,
  but this part of the channel does not lead directly towards the locks, which are not
  visible upon the face of the water. Moreover, they are presently hidden altogether by
  the land. Not until Mile 5, near Mindi, is reached does the course of the Canal, by a
  slight bend, open up the locks to uninterrupted view, and at this point the ship is
  already confined between banks. When the foot of the flight of three locks is reached a
  vessel will no longer proceed under her own steam, but be warped through.</p>

  <p>The length and width of the locks has already been stated. The maximum lift will be
  32 feet, or about 4 feet more than in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id=
  "Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>any other locks at present in use. As the width (110 feet)
  is much greater than that of existing locks, it follows that the lock gates will be far
  larger than any now in use. The vessel has to pass through a flight of three succeeding
  locks. Parallel with this is a second flight of three locks, so that two ships could be
  simultaneously put through either flight in the same, or in opposite, directions. Each
  lock through which the vessel passes on her upward course is provided with two pairs of
  mitre gates, <i>i.e.</i>, double-swinging doors, but the uppermost lock has in addition
  a rolling gate near the lower end. This is a precaution against the breaking through of
  the upper folding doors by a ship coming down, <i>i.e.</i>, from the Pacific side. An
  emergency gate is also being designed, a sort of swing bridge, to close the upper
  entrance to the flight of locks, for Gatun, Pedro Miguel, and Milaflores. It is hoped
  that a vessel will be put through all three locks at Gatun in 50 minutes, to which must
  be added some delay in approaching. Coming from the Atlantic <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>the water of the Canal will
  be smooth, and the vessel somewhat sheltered, so that there should be no difficulty.
  Approaching from the lake there may be some roughness, but anything more than a fresh
  breeze is rare, and the lake will be practically free from currents, so that the
  approach should present little difficulty. The Pacific side is always calm, so that no
  difficulty of approach or exit is to be anticipated there on account of either winds,
  waves, or currents.</p>

  <p>Our vessel, having been locked up to the broad surface of Lake Gatun, proceeds under
  her own steam and at a fair rate of speed across that lake, slowing down to about 4-1/2
  miles per hour for the 9 miles of Culebra Cut, which will thus occupy two of the 8 or
  10 hours in which it is hoped to accomplish the whole transit. On this basis it is
  calculated that 40 ships could be put through in 24 hours from the Atlantic to the
  Pacific, or two fleets of 20 ships if passing simultaneously in opposite
  directions.</p>

  <p>A 10-hour transit of the 50-mile channel is about the same rate of progress as that
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>in the Suez
  Canal, where, though there are no locks, the speed has to be kept low on account of the
  friable nature of the banks.</p>

  <p>It is evident that the time of transit cannot yet be certainly known to an hour or
  two, but a considerable margin beyond the above estimate would enable the passage to be
  made between dawn and dusk of the tropical day.</p>

  <p>At Pedro Miguel our vessel passes through one lock on her way down to the Pacific,
  and at Milaflores through two locks. Each of these three locks has, of course, a
  duplicate alongside, permitting, as at Gatun, the simultaneous passage of a companion
  vessel, or of one passing in the opposite direction. In case of repairs to one set of
  locks the parallel set would maintain the waterway.</p>

  <p>The lift of the lower lock at Milaflores is variable, depending upon the level of
  the tidal water in the last reach of the Canal. The extreme range of the tide at La
  Boca, the Pacific entrance to the Canal, is 20 feet; that is to say, low water during
  "spring" tides is 10 feet below the average sea-level. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>During low tide on the Pacific side,
  therefore, the water in the Canal stands 95, instead of 85, feet above that sea. Hence
  the maximum lift of 32 feet already stated, for</p><p><span class="c15">32 &times; 3 =

  <p>Beyond the Milaflores locks our vessel enters a reach of the Canal which is exposed
  to the ebb and flow of the tide and <i>which will be confined within banks or levees as
  far as La Boca</i>. In this respect the plan and the section are both, unfortunately,
  misleading. The La Boca lock and dam have been abandoned, and no Sosa lake will
  therefore come into existence, the lowest lock being, as I have said, at Milaflores. I
  have thought it better to reproduce the existing maps as they stand rather than to
  attempt a re-draught which would necessarily be imperfect. Our vessel, then, below
  Milaflores is in a tidal channel and will be subject to some tidal current. By
  designing this channel so as to avoid a bottle neck, and by giving it a width of 500
  feet, the calculated current will, however, not exceed 1 foot per second.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

  <p>The La Boca site for locks was found to be much too exposed to gun fire and other
  modes of attack from the sea, whereas the Milaflores site is not only distant about 5
  miles from the shore, but is well sheltered both by hills near it and by the position
  of the hilly eminences of the shore line.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the map that the dredged sea channel by which our vessel will
  reach deep water on the Pacific passes to the west of the Isle of Naos instead of to
  the east, as was proposed in the earlier plans.</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>Returning now to the Gatun locks. The mitre sill of the top lock is 37 feet above
  mean sea-level, <i>i.e.</i>, 48 feet below the surface of the lake, which is 85 feet
  above mean sea-level. But the bottom of the lake here is only about 5 feet above
  sea-level, the total depth of water immediately above the locks and dam being 80 feet.
  It follows that, in the extreme case of both gates of one of the top locks (as well as
  the roller gate) being wrecked, the level of the water <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>in the lake can only fall to the level of +37,
  which would leave a depth of 32 feet immediately above the dam. Ships of large draft
  could therefore lie there without being stranded. Moreover, the lake is so large that
  the outflow through the broken locks would only lower the level 2 feet <i>per diem</i>,
  so that more than three weeks would elapse before the water sank to the level of the
  mitre sill.</p>

  <p>Again, the channel provided by the broken lock would be so small that in the Canal
  below the calculated current which would result from the outflow would have a velocity
  of only 3-1/2 miles per hour.</p>

  <p>Above the Pedro Miguel and Milaflores locks there is not the same surplus depth of
  water, so that vessels might be grounded if the locks were broken. Moreover, as there
  is no wide-spreading lake above Pedro Miguel, the outflow of water would generate a
  somewhat swift current above the lock, which might be a source of danger to ships.</p>

  <p>This circumstance serves to enforce the apparent paradox that the great area of
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Lake Gatun is in
  several respects an element of safety, not, as the layman might suppose, of danger. The
  hydrostatic pressure upon the dam depends, of course, solely upon the depth of water,
  not upon the area of the lake, while the greater the contents of the reservoir the more
  nearly stagnant are its waters.</p>

  <p>As there is to be no lock at La Boca, the dams shown there on the plan and profile
  will not have to be constructed, so that it is not necessary to deal with the questions
  to which they formerly gave rise.</p>

  <p>In the vicinity of the locks at Pedro Miguel and Milaflores, however, dams have to
  be constructed to hold up the water. At both places the dams will be short, and will be
  founded upon hard rock,<sup>[16]</sup> and in each case the head of water to be held up
  will only be about 40 feet, instead of 80, as at Gatun. The construction of the dams at
  Pedro Miguel and Milaflores is not, therefore, regarded with anxiety.</p>

  <p>The great Gatun dam remains the one important experiment in the whole scheme of the
  high-level Canal, and much attention is being devoted to the planning of this work. The
  alluvial foundation is a disadvantage shared by the Bohio site formerly chosen, and all
  other sites in the lower Chagres valley; so that, having decided upon the Panama route,
  and a high-level canal, there appears to be no alternative to the construction of a dam
  upon this kind of bottom. The details of the proposed structure, as elaborated in
  April, 1908, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The length of the great earthen dam at Gatun is 7,700 feet, its breadth no less than
  2,060 feet. The weight of the dam per linear foot is more than 60 times the horizontal
  pressure of the water in the lake, so that the pressure could not move the whole mass;
  and the weight of the dam is spread over such a great width that it is not thought that
  the ground will sink beneath it. The form of the plan and section is shown on the map,
  and an idea of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
  71]</a></span>the topography may be obtained from the photographs, which I took in
  April, 1908. The south-eastern end of the dam abuts on the hill of hard, fine-grained,
  argillaceous sandstone in which the lock-site is being excavated.</p>

  <p>The dam, according to these plans, is not to be merely superposed upon the surface,
  as originally proposed in 1905. Embedded in its earthy mass there is to be a puddled
  core, and a trench will be excavated to a level of 40 feet below the sea (-40 feet) for
  the lower part of this core. Nor is this all that is to be done to check seepage
  beneath the earthen dam. From the bottom of the trench excavated for the puddled core,
  sheet piling, made of 4-inch timbers, is to be driven down for another 40 feet, so that
  sheet piling and puddled core together will form an impervious barrier to -80 feet;
  that is to say, 80 feet below the surface-level of the sea, or about 85 feet below the
  lowest natural surface of the ground. The puddled core is carried up through the
  earthen dam to the level of +90, that is to say, 5 feet <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>above the level of the lake, which is to be 85
  feet above sea. The crest of the dam will be +135 feet, <i>i.e.</i>, 50 feet above the
  level of the lake; this excess of height being to provide top weight for increased
  stability of the whole structure, and also for the purpose of compacting the underlying
  material. The underwater slopes of the earthy materials have been reduced from the 1:3
  of 1905 to 1:5. On the other hand, it has been decided that the width of 2,625 feet
  given in 1905 was in excess of utility, and that a reduction of between 500 and 600
  feet can be made without loss of strength or efficiency.</p>

  </div>

  <p>About half way across the valley occurs a low hill, on which a house is shown in the
  photograph. This hill is on the crest-line of the dam, and is useful as giving support
  to the sides of the regulating channel which will be excavated in it. The material of
  the hill, however, is not the hard argillaceous sandstone of the lock site, but merely
  alluvial. The regulating works themselves will be built of concrete: a solid mass built
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>up to +69 feet,
  and on this piers will be constructed 8 feet in thickness, between which will be the
  sluice-gates. By their means the level of the lake will be prevented from rising unduly
  in flood time.</p>

  <p>The capability of the dam to maintain the waters of the lake at a sufficient level
  in the dry season depends upon their not finding a ready way either through the dam
  itself or below it. The construction of the dam is believed to guarantee its own
  practical impermeability. Not only is there a puddled core, but the mud, sand, and
  rocks of which the principal mass will be composed will be laid down in the manner best
  calculated to secure compactness. With regard to underground flow, there is an
  underlying bed of indurated clay which is regarded as sufficiently impervious, and
  wherever the puddled core and piling are imbedded in that clay it may, I think, be
  assumed with some confidence that the leakage will be unimportant. On referring to the
  section (map), however, it will be seen that there are in the valley two old river
  gorges, which to a depth <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
  74]</a></span>of 200 and 260 feet are filled only with gravel, sand; sand, shells, and
  wood; clayey sand, and so forth. These gorges, measured on the section shown in the
  figure, have widths of about 1,200 and 500 feet respectively at the depth to which the
  sheet piling goes, and extend about 120 and 180 feet below. How much water may escape
  by these gorges it is difficult to say. This leads us to the next division of our
  subject.</p>

  <p class="c11">On the Supply of Water Available for the Needs of the High-level
  Canal.</p>

  <p>The construction of the Suez Canal was a work of excavation pure and simple. The
  construction of any kind of canal across the Isthmus of Panama involves another task,
  second only in importance to the primary work of excavation, viz., that of regulating
  the rivers.</p>

  <p>In the case of a sea-level canal the problem would have been how to get rid of their
  waters, particularly in the rainy season.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

  <p>In the actual case of an 85-foot-level canal, the regulation of the rivers,
  particularly of the Chagres, presents two aspects, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) In the wet season, disposing of the surplus waters.</p>

  <p>(2) In the dry season, conserving water supplied by the rains so as to meet the
  waste caused (<i>a</i>) by locking, (<i>b</i>) by evaporation, (<i>c</i>) by
  percolation.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for taming the torrents of the Chagres and its tributaries have
  already been described. They are, briefly, the construction of the Gatun dam and its
  spillway.</p>

  <p>Turning to the other aspect of the problem, I have to answer the question, What is
  the guarantee that there will be sufficient water in the dry season?</p>

  <p>Probably there is no problem of the Panama Canal which has received more prolonged
  and careful study than this. From the outset the French engineers commenced collecting
  data relating to the hydrology of the Isthmus, and when funds grew low, and the
  pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>posed level
  of the canal began to rise, the matter received ever-increasing attention. The
  <i>Comit&eacute; Technique</i> of the New Panama Canal Company commenced in 1894
  elaborate investigations to determine the catchment area, the amount of rainfall, and
  the discharge of rivers. Brigadier-General Henry L. Abbot (late Corps of Engineers,
  U.S.A.), whose investigations upon the Mississippi are known the world over, was a
  member of this Committee of the New Panama Company until the work was taken over by the
  Government of the United States, for whom he continued to act; and he was a member of
  the Board of Consulting Engineers, signing the minority report in favour of an
  85-foot-level canal in January, 1906. A continuous study for seven years is an
  advantage enjoyed by few of the American engineers, and the book on "Problems of the
  Panama Canal" published by General Abbot in 1905 (new edition 1907) deals very fully
  and ably with the hydrology and meteorology of the Isthmus. The observations were
  continued under the direction of Don Ricardo <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77"
  id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>M. Arango, who has also a long experience on the
  Isthmus. I shall not attempt to summarise the mass of data upon which the authorities
  rely in their calculation that there is a sufficient water supply for the needs of the
  Canal during the dry season, contenting myself with showing, as above, that in this
  department of study, which more than all others connected with the Canal demands long
  experience, this requisite has in fact been secured. Yet whatever depends upon climate
  is liable to unexpected accidents, and personally I regard as an important safeguard
  the fact that at Alhajuela, on the Chagres, 9 or 10 miles above Obispo, there is an
  excellent site for a dam, which would form a reservoir where some of the surplus water
  of the wet season could be stored, and supplied to the Canal as required. The details
  for such a dam were elaborated in connection with one of the earlier plans of the
  Canal, so that the necessary data would be immediately available in case its
  construction should become necessary in the future.</p>

  <p class="c11">Harbours and Fortifications.</p>

  <p>There are no storms in the Bay of Panama, and but little additional protection from
  weather is needed there for shipping. The entrance to the Canal being at La Boca, a new
  city will grow up there. This will be the second westward migration of the terminal
  port, the present city of Panama lying between Old Panama and La Boca.</p>

  <p>Colon is exposed to northers, and protection against the heavy sea which then rolls
  in will have to be provided. Whether this will be done by breakwaters or by forming an
  interior basin is not yet decided, and the cost of this part of the Canal works is
  therefore not yet known.</p>

  <p>The Canal, as already stated, is to be fortified; but I made no inquiries as to the
  location or character of the proposed fortifications, a matter which I regarded as
  outside my province. The cost of fortifications is included in the provision made by
  Congress for the Canal.</p>

  <h5>ON THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE CULEBRA CUT, AND ON THE METHODS EMPLOYED FOR
  EXCAVATION AND DISPOSAL OF THE SPOIL</h5>

  <p class="introduction"><span class="first-letter">R</span>EFERENCE once more to the
  plan and profile on the map will show at a glance the length and position of the rocky
  divide, the whole of which is termed the Culebra Cut, from the name of the town near
  the highest point. The proposed form and dimensions of this cut, throughout the 5 miles
  of the greatest height, is also shown (the section adopted at the commencement of
  1906), and the stage reached in April, 1908, is shown by the photographs. The line
  drawn across the above section at a level of 120 feet above bottom (160 feet above
  sea), shows the general level of the bottom of the workings at Culebra itself at the
  time the photographs <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
  82]</a></span>were taken. A narrow pilot cut, only, was then 20 feet lower.</p>

  <div class="figcenter c2">
    <img src="images/82a.jpg" width="500" height="566" alt="" title=
    "" /> <span class="caption">ROCK DRILL.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="figcenter c2">
    <img src="images/82b.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt=
    "" title="" />
    <span class="caption">ROCK DRILLS AT WORK IN THE CUT.</span>
  </div>

  <p>All that part of the section below this line (+160) remained to be excavated.</p>

  <p>Most of the rock above this line has been removed, but not all, for the final width
  is not, of course, reached at any level until the central portion has been excavated
  below that level.</p>

  <p>The level of the original rock line shown in this section was +275, <i>i.e.</i>, 235
  above canal bottom, so that the photographs show excavation of 115 feet of rock. There
  was, however, soil above the hard basaltic rock, of varying thickness&mdash;removed to
  the slope 1:2 as shown on the section. The highest original surface of the soil on the
  centre line of the Canal (between Golden Hill and Silver Hill at Culebra) was +312
  feet,<sup>[17]</sup> so that the photographs in which Golden Hill appears show a total
  excavation of 152 feet along the centre line. As this line passed along a saddle
  between the two hills, the original surface at the sides was considerably higher, so
  that the total height shown in the photographs from the bottom of the cut to the
  highest berm, or ledge, on Golden Hill is considerably more than 152 feet.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[17]</sup> The profile at end of volume shows the stage of excavation when
    the height here had been reduced to +210.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

  <p>The bottom of the Canal will be 272 feet below the original saddle, and its depth
  below this berm, which is seen on the photograph, is considerably more. Thus will the
  gorge appear when the excavation is finished and before the water is allowed to flow
  in. When full, the surface of the water will be 227 feet below the original saddle, and
  the passenger on a vessel will gaze upon the scarped banks of a somewhat greater height
  than this.</p>

  <p>For a tide-level canal, not only would the depth be 85 feet greater, but, as the
  slope could not be made steeper, the width of the whole cutting would be
  correspondingly increased.</p>

  <p>With reference to the slope of the sides, it is important to note that it has not
  been found practicable to adhere always to the proposed section, which has to be made
  flatter, thus considerably increasing the amount of excavation required. The behaviour
  of living rock is not susceptible of the precise specifica<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>tion which can be applied to
  quarried stone on the one hand or loose gravel on the other. Mechanically it is
  complex, both on account of its structure and of the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which water
  plays in its economy. In the case of the Culebra rock, the volcanic dykes by which it
  is traversed have altered the nature of the rock in their vicinity, and the part played
  by water is considerable, owing to the wetness of the climate. Moreover, the rock does
  not remain wholly unchanged when exposed to air, but deteriorates by "weathering," a
  chemical and physical process which proceeds much faster in an equatorial climate than
  in the temperate zones. The climate, however, has a compensating action, in so far as
  the rapid growth of vegetation soon clothes and protects the scarped slopes, thus
  acting as a "revetment."</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>Alighting at Culebra station on the Panama Railway, and proceeding to the western
  side of the cut, one obtains the most impressive view of the Canal works, and this is
  the spot usually visited by travellers and tourists. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>I first stood there in January, 1907, and
  returned in April, 1908. The impressions obtained were very different on these two
  occasions. In January, 1907, after two and a half years of American occupation, what
  struck me most was the enormous mass of material which had been removed by the French
  companies, and the comparatively insignificant appearance of the American excavations,
  which could readily be distinguished from the older work, already coated with
  vegetation. It was then that I began to appreciate the heroic labours of the French
  engineers, whose achievements under circumstances of great difficulty are being daily
  more and more appreciated and praised by their successors. Turning to study the
  progress of work, I watched with delight the operations of the 100-ton steam shovels,
  which at a distance, when the human hands are not seen, appear endowed with volition,
  and remind the spectator of elephants at work. The cars were loaded with surprising
  celerity, and the dirt-train was hauled off to the distant dump by an old Belgian
  locomo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>tive, part
  of the machinery taken over from the New Company. But then the hitch came&mdash;there
  were no cars to take the place of those already filled, and the steam shovel was idle.
  Looking round, I found that many other steam shovels and their crews were idle from the
  same cause, the machinery for transportation not having been provided in proper
  proportion to the machinery of excavation. That the time required for the completion of
  the rock-cut was limited by the possible rate of transportation of spoil, and not by
  that of excavation, had long been known, and the report of the Board of Consulting
  Engineers contains elaborate diagrams of space available for shovels and for tracks. It
  was apparent, therefore, that the organisation of the work was not yet perfected. In
  like manner, as far as I could judge during my first short visit, the West Indian
  labour was not yielding the best results, owing to white foremen and coloured labourers
  not being in perfect harmony.</p>

  </div>

  <p>While, however, the fighting force, so to speak, of the Isthmian army was obviously
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>imperfect in
  many respects, great results had evidently been achieved by the auxiliary services. The
  Department of Sanitation had already made the Isthmus healthier than most equatorial
  countries, food and quarters were excellent, law and order were well maintained.</p>

  <p>On the first day of my second and prolonged visit, April, 1908, fifteen months
  later, I went at once to the same spot on the Culebra Cut opposite to Golden Hill and
  again surveyed the scene of operations. The change was enormous. The gorge below me was
  greatly enlarged, the shape of the hills altered, the face of the landscape changed. As
  I gazed into the deep trench below, the thought flashed across my mind, "If my life be
  spared a few years longer, I will sail through this on a ship."</p>

  <p>The reason of the great change was readily apparent: organisation had now been
  perfected. In the first place, the whole width of the cut was laid down in railway
  tracks, tier above tier at the different levels, so that the view was like the approach
  to the metropolitan terminus of one of the world's <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>great railways. Up and down these tracks there
  came and went without ceasing the spoil-trains, now composed of larger trucks than
  formerly, with new and ingenious devices for rapid unloading. The number of steam
  shovels visible was much larger than in 1906, yet they were kept constantly busy, and
  all the time the drilling machines were at work boring holes for charges of dynamite,
  and gangs of men were completing the preparations for explosions in other holes already
  made.<sup>[18]</sup> Yet if the eyes were raised for a moment from the busy scene
  below, they rested on a silent wilderness of tropical forest, stretching unbroken to
  the horizon. I stayed until, at the approach of sunset, the work of the shovels ceased,
  and hundreds of men swarmed out of the Cut, and sought their quarters and the evening
  meal. But all was not over for the day, for now, when the Cut was cleared, the
  shot-firing began. At intervals there occurred a deafening explosion, the earth
  trembled as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> in a
  considerable, but preternaturally short, earthquake, and masses of rock rolled down the
  slopes, disintegrated and ready for the shovel-man when he should arrive next morning.
  I paid many visits to the Cut, between Empire and Pedro Miguel, but oftenest at Culebra
  itself. The sight never palls, and is one of the wonders of the world. The Pyramids are
  another wonder of the world which in common with many thousands in all ages I have
  thought it worth going to see&mdash;but to go to Culebra is as if one were privileged
  to watch the building of the Pyramids. Yet how few go to the Isthmus on purpose to see
  these things, and, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, how few Americans! How is it that this
  people, so enthusiastic in all that relates to national achievement and addicted to
  foreign travel, does not include the Isthmus among its many recognised places of
  pilgrimage? Of the Americans whom I met on the Zone there was scarcely one who had come
  voluntarily for pleasure. The hotel accommodation, it is true, is limited, but it is
  more than sufficient for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
  90]</a></span>present needs, and is good, as hotels in the tropics are reckoned.
  Moreover, Panama is now one of the healthiest places in the Equatorial Zone. English
  tourists going out to the West Indies by the Royal Mail are generally able to cross the
  Isthmus and see something of the work while their ship is unloading at Colon; but I
  would venture to suggest, to such of these as care to follow the world's progress, that
  they should make arrangements beforehand to step off at Colon, cross to Panama, put up
  there, visit thence the Canal works at various points, and proceed by their next ship.
  The West Indian tourist season coincides with the dry season on the Isthmus. At Panama
  the mosquito is almost an extinct animal, and though the heat there is sometimes
  trying, a run up to Culebra brings one to a dry and bracing atmosphere where a fresh
  breeze is almost always blowing.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[18]</sup> During 1908 no less than one million dynamite charges were
    exploded.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The steam shovel is the principal agent of excavation. It scoops out loose soil
  directly, but the basaltic rock has to be broken up first by blasting. One shovel
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>will load 1,200
  cubic yards of such materials upon the cars within the working day of 8 hours, an
  amount equal to 600 two-horse loads.</p>

  <p>For accelerating transportation railway trucks provided with flaps are used, which
  make of the whole train a single platform. At the rear of the train is a plough which
  can be drawn by a wire rope attached to a drum carried on a special car in the fore
  part of the train. When the train arrives at the dump the drum is started, and the
  plough, advancing, clears the 320 cubic yards of earth and rock from the 16 cars in 7
  minutes. This is the Lidgerwood Unloader.</p>

  <p>Another important piece of machinery is the track-shifter, which picks up and relays
  the railway lines of the ever-shifting spoil-tracks. This remarkably successful
  contrivance was invented by an employee on the Isthmus, and is moreover manufactured
  there in the great workshops at Gorgona.</p>

  </div>

  <p>From Bas Obispo to Pedro Miguel, which constitutes the Cut, is a distance of about 9
  miles, and excavation is so planned that a summit is maintained at Lirio, near Culebra,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>about half-way
  between these two points. On the north slope are<sup>[19]</sup> 21 steam shovels,
  loading cars on 14 tracks. These, when loaded, are hauled down-grade to the northern
  dumps at Tavernilla and elsewhere, or to the site of the Gatun dam, which is also a
  dump. Nearly 4,000 cubic yards of rock are carried to the dam daily, a distance of
  about 24 miles. The return up-grade is made with empty cars. On the southern slope
  about the same number of steam shovels are at work, the spoil being taken to the
  southern dumping grounds on the Pacific side, including the trestle dump for the
  breakwater to Naos Island. The spoil-trains follow one another at intervals of about
  three minutes, and if, from any cause, delay occur, the steam shovels, and indeed the
  whole process of excavation, is brought to a standstill. Any cause of delay is
  therefore reported at once by telephone to the Superintendent of Transportation at
  Empire, and all energies are at once directed to clearing the way. On the Isthmus
  everything gives way to the spoil-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id=
  "Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>train, as in a city to the fire-engine. An excellent lesson
  both in the complexity and urgency of the transportation is afforded by a run through
  the Cut on a motor trolley in company with the Superintendent of the Department of
  Excavation. Constantly shunted from one track to another, and occasionally having to
  retreat, much ingenuity is required to thread a way among the spoil-trains, but even
  the almost invaluable time of the Superintendent himself is sacrificed rather than any
  delay should occur to the "dirt" train, as it is usually called. It is this dirt which
  stands between the American nation and the realisation of their long cherished scheme,
  and nowhere is the classical definition of dirt as "matter in the wrong place" so
  appropriate as on the Isthmus.</p>

  id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>when examined early in 1908 at Washington, declined to
  bind himself to a date for completion, or to an estimate of cost; nevertheless, it is
  not difficult to calculate the date of completion from the actual rate of progress on
  the assumption that all goes well. The year 1915 is thus arrived at by the authorities
  for the calculated, though not promised, completion. This is based primarily upon the
  rate of excavation possible under the restrictions imposed by the narrow gorge along
  which the spoil has to be transported. It has been also calculated that the
  constructive works, the locks and dams, would require about the same time as, but not
  longer than, the excavations. This just balance between the time required for the two
  elements, excavation and building, was one of the arguments employed in favour of the
  85-foot-level canal, as securing "the utmost practicable speed of
  construction"<sup>[22]</sup> which could be obtained in a canal "afford<span class=

  circumstances of one of the great manufacturing towns, and forgot for the time my
  actual surroundings. It was with a feeling akin to surprise that, on quitting the
  foundry, I found myself on the fringe of the tropical forest, now darkening with the

  spade work is done by new immigrants, some of whom settle, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>and some go home with
  their savings. They are largely from Southern and Central Europe, many being Italians,
  and in the extreme West there are Japanese also.</p>

  <p>The Commission, however, did not recruit in the United States, in order not to
  disturb the labour market there, but sought elsewhere for the supply of unskilled
  labour.</p>

  <p>At first they relied almost entirely upon the West Indian negro, who formed the
  majority of the navvies employed under the French Companies. The Commission, however,
  were profoundly dissatisfied with the result. In December, 1906, they reported
  that&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Another year's experience with negro labourers from near-by tropical islands and
  countries has convinced the Commission of the impossibility of doing satisfactory work
  with them. Not only do they seem to be disqualified by lack of actual vitality, but
  their disposition to labour seems to be as frail as their bodily strength."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they are still employed in undiminished numbers on the Isthmus, and
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>the tone of
  the authorities towards them has changed. This change is noticeable both in the
  official publications and also in the conversation of the foremen immediately in
  charge. With regard to the latter, I found a great difference of tone between January,
  1907, and April, 1908.</p>

  <p>The improved relations with the West Indians is due to two causes, relating to the
  alleged lack of vitality and of industry respectively. The lack of strength was found
  to be due largely to improper diet, and most of the West Indians are now provided with
  proper cooked meals, as is done in the case of American and European employees. In
  order to ensure their profiting by this provision, however, the charge for meals in the
  case of West Indians is deducted from wages. The result of supplying a nourishing diet
  has been a marked increase in working strength as shown by output.</p>

  <p>In respect of disposition to labour there has also been an improvement. This is
  shown both by the absence of animadversion in later official reports, and also by the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>changed tone
  of the foremen and other Americans in immediate control of the West Indians, when
  questioned on the subject. In January, 1907, I heard little but disparagement, while in
  April, 1908, a much more favourable account was given. To one who has seen something of
  both the United States and of the West Indies, the reason for the improved state of
  affairs was easily understood, viz., the American foremen and others in charge had
  begun to understand the type of men with whom they were dealing. Accustomed to the
  character of the American negro, and to the conventions which regulate intercourse with
  the coloured man in the United States, they did not at first recognise that the West
  Indian was a distinct type, and accustomed, at any rate in the British Colonies, to
  very different social relations towards the white man. The handling of a gang of
  negroes from the tropics is an art which has had to be learnt.</p>

  <p>The Barbadians are reported to be, generally speaking, the best of the West Indian
  workmen, except the men from some of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id=
  "Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>country districts of Jamaica, who are their equals.
  Although the climate and products of the Isthmus are so similar to those of their own
  islands, comparatively few of these employees settle there, but return to the homes
  they love so well. It cannot but be gratifying to an Englishman to find that those who
  come from the British islands are proud of their citizenship and pleased to greet him
  as a fellow-subject.</p>

  <p>There are about ninety negro policemen on the Zone, most of whom were originally
  trained by English officers in the Jamaica Constabulary. They are highly spoken of by
  the Chief of Police, who finds that they know both when to arrest and when not to
  arrest. They are also of much service to the new arrivals of their own colour, who
  refer to them for all information.</p>

  <p>The ordinary West Indian labourer receives 10 cents gold (about 5d.) per hour and
  free quarters. Deducting the 30 cents <i>per diem</i> charged for meals, he receives 50
  cents (2s. 1d.) for an 8-hour day, besides food and lodging.</p>

  are necessarily absentees every day owing to sickness, accident, or other cause.</p>

  <p><i>European Labour on the Isthmus</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1906 the number of European labourers on the Isthmus was insignificant, and the
  Commission, at that time profoundly dissatisfied with the West Indians, issued
  invitations for proposals to furnish 2,500 Chinese labourers, with the privilege of
  increasing the number to 15,000.<sup>[23]</sup> Nothing came of this scheme, however,
  while, on the other hand, the already improved, and still improving, conditions on the
  Isthmus enabled the Commission to obtain a largely increased supply of European labour.
  While the supply of West Indians was maintained constant, or only slowly increased, the
  additional force required was therefore obtained from Europe. The following figures
  show this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>A few Russian and Baltic folk came, but appeared unable to stand the work, and the
  few French who arrived did not take to pick and spade. The majority were from Greece,
  Italy, and Spain, each of these countries sending at first about the same number. The
  Greeks proved to be physically inferior to the Italians and Spaniards, and their number
  in April, 1908, was only about 300.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

  <p>The Italians, physically excellent, and standing the climate well, were found
  somewhat intractable. A large proportion were migrant labourers, who had become
  somewhat prone to collective action when dissatisfied, and their numbers in April,
  1908, had been reduced to 500 or 600.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards, mainly Galicians and Castilians, were found to be quite equal to the
  Italians in physique and health, and to give far less trouble, a fact which is
  attributed partly to the circumstance that most of them came directly from their
  villages. They are reported to be sober, patient, civil, and quick to learn. The number
  employed in April, 1908, was about 5,000, so that the Spaniards constituted about
  five-sixths of the European force, which numbered in all slightly over 6,000. The
  figures given above for those at work on certain days are considerably less, there
  being always a number absent from one cause or another.</p>

  <p>That the Spaniard is not oppressed by the tropical heat was apparent to me when
  watching gangs at work near mid-day at about the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>hottest time of year, viz., the last weeks
  of the dry season, towards the end of April. Clothed in European kit, wearing velveteen
  trousers and with only a cap for head-covering, these men showed no signs of distress,
  or even discomfort. They showed, in fact, less sign of being heated than Americans of
  apparently British or other Northern descent engaged upon less laborious work.</p>

  <p>The ordinary European labourer, in addition to free quarters, receives 20 cents gold
  per hour, or $1.60 per 8-hour day; more when working overtime. He is charged 40 cents
  <i>per diem</i> for his three meals, served in the European mess, which leaves $1.20 as
  a <i>minimum</i> net wage <i>per diem</i>, or a little less than 30s. per week; but
  many earn more, and it should not be difficult under these conditions for a labourer to
  save &pound;5 a month. I was informed of one instance of a Spanish labourer saving
  &pound;10 per month, but such virtue must be rare.</p>

  <p>The Spaniard shows no sign of settling upon the Zone. Sometimes he goes on to
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>railway work
  in Brazil; more often he returns home with his savings.</p>

  <p class="c11">Skilled Labour on the Isthmus.</p>

  <p>The skilled labour on the Isthmus has from the outset been mainly done by white
  Americans, but there are still on the "Gold Roll," as it is termed, some Europeans. New
  rules reducing the maximum length of leave have, however, made these posts less
  attractive to those whose homes are at a greater distance, and by an order of February
  8, 1908, all future appointments on the Gold Roll shall be American citizens, if the
  special services required can be obtained in the United States; and in the event of any
  reduction of force, preference shall be given to American citizens.</p>

  <p>The duties being various, the pay necessarily differs, but, taking free quarters
  into account, is higher than in the United States, as is of course necessary in a
  distant and tropical land. Since the industrial difficulties of 1907-8 there has been
  considerable competition for these billets. An 8-hour day <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>is established by law for
  employees on the Gold Roll, the quarters are excellent, and the three meals a day
  provided at a fixed charge are up to the standard of a good hotel. Indeed, the
  opportunity to share these meals, supplied in large airy rooms, screened by gauze but
  open to the breeze, made my task on the Isthmus much lighter. From almost any part of
  the Canal I could reach one of the Commission "hotels" for meal-time, and for 50 cents
  (2s. 1d.) obtain better food than I have generally been able to get in the tropics at a
  much higher price. I took pleasure also in my company, for, if I may be permitted to
  say so, the skilled mechanic of the United States has always seemed to me a most
  attractive representative of his nation; and here particularly so, where one is in
  touch with his work. Moreover, each man's job on the Isthmus is part of a vast
  undertaking, the progress of which he can watch, which fires his enthusiasm, and makes
  him feel that he has a reward beyond his wage in the privilege of participating in
  national achievement.</p>

  <p>The number of Americans on the Gold Roll in January, 1908, was about 6,000, the

  <p class="c11">The Responsible Officials and the Scheme of their Organisation.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for Canal construction under the conditions laid down by Acts of
  Congress is vested in the President of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
  "Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>United States, within the limits of the money which has
  so far been voted. The President appointed a Commission in 1905 to carry out the work.
  The first chief engineer appointed was Mr. John F. Wallace, who arrived on the Zone
  June 28, 1904, accompanied by Colonel Gorgas, U.S.A., head of the Sanitation
  Department. Mr. Wallace was in favour of a tide-level canal. In April, 1905, the
  President appointed a second Commission in place of the first, with a changed
  <i>personnel</i>,<sup>[24]</sup> but Mr. Wallace was retained as chief engineer, and,
  moreover, became a member of the second Commission.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[24]</sup> Colonel Gorgas, head of the Department of Sanitation, has
    remained, however, through all changes. See <i>post</i>, Chapter V.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He, however, resigned, June 26, 1905, and his place was taken by Mr. John F.
  Stephens, who arrived on the Zone July 27th. At this time there was panic throughout
  the Isthmus<sup>[25]</sup> owing to the prevalent sickness, and resignations were so
  numerous that it was difficult to carry on work at all, and engineering operations were
  partly suspended for a time. When the sanitary conditions improved, however, work was
  resumed with vigour. This second Commission proposed that the work should be put out to
  contract, and bids were invited. It was under this Commission that the 85-foot-level
  canal became law. Mr. Stephens was in favour of this form. He resigned early in 1907,
  his resignation taking effect on April 1st, and at the same time the President for the
  second time reorganised the Commission.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[25]</sup> See Report of the Governor of the Canal Zone, 1905, p. 30, and
    "Sanitation in the Canal Zone," by W.C. Gorgas, M.B., Colonel, <i>Journ. Am. Med.

  <p>The third Commission, appointed April 1, 1907, which is that under which the work
  was being carried on at the time of my second visit, differs from its predecessors in
  that its members are resident on the Zone. Thus the members of the Commission are the
  actual executive, the chairman of the Commission being himself chief
  engineer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> The
  other important difference between the present and the former organisations is the fact
  that almost all the important departments are now under officers of the United States
  Army, and in one instance of the Navy. The chairman and chief engineer,
  Lieutenant-Colonel George W. Goethals, of the Corps of Engineers, had previous
  experience of the Isthmus, having been engaged upon work connected with fortification.
  With respect to the other officers of engineers, the significance of the appointments
  lies not in their being military men, but in their being permanent Government servants.
  The Government of the United States, unlike that of his Britannic Majesty, does not
  possess a large Civil Service whose members remain in the public employment through all
  changes of political parties. In the absence of any considerable body corresponding,
  for instance, to our Indian Civil Service, the Government of the United States
  frequently relies upon the Corps of Engineers for the supervision of great public
  works.</p>

  <p>Technically the Panama Railroad is not a department, but practically the
  construction of the Canal and the reconstruction of the Railroad are worked as parts of
  a single scheme.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above are some smaller divisions, reporting directly to the
  Chairman, such as that of Accounts. The office of the Purchasing Officer is situate in
  Washington, practically all the supplies being obtained in the United States. This
  officer also reports to the Chairman resident on the Zone.</p>

  <p>The numbers given above are subject to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id=
  "Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>continual fluctuation, and are quoted more for the
  purpose of showing the general proportions of the different parts of the undertaking
  than to give an exact total of the force employed.</p>

  <p>Some account has already been given of the activities of the men employed on
  excavation, on locks and dams, and on the railway. Those entered under the Department
  of Machinery and Buildings are charged not only with this work in the Zone, but also
  with the paving and other improvements in the cities of Colon and Panama. The
  Department of Sanitation also undertakes the hygiene of these two cities, no small part
  of its responsibilities. The Republic of Panama provides the cities with police, who
  are Panamanians. The police force of the Isthmian Canal Commission (Department of Civil
  Administration) numbers 200, of whom 88 are the West Indians already mentioned and the
  remainder white Americans. The force is numerically small, but the power to deport all
  undesirable persons is of great assistance. Moreover, as the Zone is practically
  inaccessible except from the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg
  118]</a></span>ports of Colon and Panama, a fairly complete watch can be kept on all
  entries. After making due allowance for all these advantages, however, one cannot but
  be impressed, not only by the order, but by the respectability of the Isthmus, which is
  singularly free from anything unseemly.</p>

  <p>A scattered force of 200 would be insufficient to deal with tumult among so large a
  population of men, but there is maintained at Obispo, a central point, a force of about
  350 United States Marines.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

  (previous to 1906) has always been prevalent among white strangers, and most other
  visitors, and particularly to the high percentage of death from yellow fever. To this
  short, sharp, and most deadly disease the native-born is immune; hence the affairs of
  the city of Panama have gone on well enough for centuries, as far as the residents are
  concerned, except that travellers by the Isthmian route tarried no longer than they
  could help. Whenever large numbers of strangers have congregated on the Isthmus, as
  during the Californian gold-rush, the construction of the railway, and the Canal
  construction of the French Companies, there has been an epidemic of yellow fever among
  them, and a very large proportion of cases have terminated fatally.</p>

  <p>The immunity which the West Indian negro enjoys from this disease gave him a
  superiority over other labourers on the Isthmus which, since the extinction of the
  disease, is no longer his.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg
  123]</a></span></p>

  <p>During the American occupation of Havana, after the American-Spanish War, yellow
  fever broke out among the strangers, and the mere cleaning up of the city, though
  carried out with military thoroughness, had no effect in checking the disease. A
  medical board was sent to study the matter. This was in 1900, four years after Major
  Ronald Ross, of the Indian Medical Service, had discovered the cause of malaria. Ross
  had proved that the cause of malaria in man was the presence in his blood of an
  organism introduced by the attack of the <i>anopheles</i> gnat (or mosquito), and that
  the species was only poisonous to man if it had itself become infected with the germ of
  this organism in biting a man suffering from malaria. Thus man and <i>anopheles</i> act
  alternately as hosts to the organism, which apparently requires their co-operation for
  the continuance of its species.</p>

  <p>Gnats, or mosquitoes, as they are indifferently termed, being thus under more than
  suspicion as an immediate cause of tropical fevers, the medical board turned their
  attention <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>to
  them, and Mr. Reed, a member of the board, tracked the yellow fever to another gnat,
  the <i>stegomyia</i>, and, aided by the heroic devotion of his assistants, proved
  beyond shadow of doubt that this disease is due to the activity of another minute
  organism, which lives a double life in man and <i>stegomyia</i>. Mere contact with the
  clothing, &amp;c., of yellow-fever patients was proved to be no source of
  infection.</p>

  <p>The <i>stegomyia</i> lives three months. It becomes dangerous only by imbibing the
  organism through attacking man during the first three days of yellow fever, and, even
  then, twelve days elapse before its bite is infectious. Six days after a man has been
  bitten by an infectious <i>stegomyia</i> he develops yellow fever, and for the next
  three days (as has been already said) he is infectious to the <i>stegomyia</i>.</p>

  <p>During the American occupation of Cuba attempts were made to obtain immunity from
  yellow fever, but it was found impossible to regulate the disease when voluntarily
  communicated by the bite of the mosquito, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125"
  id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>at present immunity is only enjoyed by persons who
  inherit the privilege.</p>

  <p>The <i>stegomyia</i> does not breed in open swamps or large bodies of water, but
  needs shelter, and is also incapable of sustaining a long flight. It breeds chiefly in
  and near towns, depositing its larv&aelig; upon the surface of cisterns or stagnant
  pools.</p>

  <p>Colonel W.C. Gorgas, M.D., took charge of the Department of Sanitation of the
  Commission in July, 1904. "The experience of our predecessors," he
  writes,<sup>[27]</sup> "was ample to convince us that unless we could protect our force
  against yellow fever and malaria we would be unable to accomplish the work."</p>

  <p>At this time there was but little yellow fever on the Isthmus, and, in spite of the
  arrival of a large number of non-immunes, no alarming outbreak occurred during the
  first ten months. During April, 1905, however, the administration building in Panama,
  in which worked some 300 non-immune employees of the Commission, became infected.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>In that month
  there were 9 cases and 2 deaths; in May, 33 cases and 8 deaths, of which 21 cases and 2
  deaths were among employees of the Commission. In June there were 19 deaths from yellow
  fever on the Isthmus, and in July 13. The Commission reported<sup>[28]</sup>
  that:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A feeling of alarm, almost amounting to panic, spread among the Americans on the
  Isthmus. Many resigned their positions to return to the United States, while those who
  remained became possessed with a feeling of lethargy or fatalism, resulting from a
  conviction that no remedy existed for the peril. There was a disposition to partly
  ignore or openly condemn and abandon all preventive measures. The gravity of the crisis
  was apparent to all."</p>

  <p>Colonel Gorgas writes<sup>[29]</sup> of this time:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We could readily see that if the conditions as they existed in 1905 were to
  continue the Canal would never be finished."</p>

  <p>And he adds that:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

  <p>"The Executive Board of the Commission itself, as late as June, 1905, stated that
  the sanitary work of the Isthmus had been a failure and recommended that the
  <i>personnel</i> be changed and other methods tried. But the Supreme Authorities ...
  gave us steady support, and by the following December yellow fever had disappeared from
  the Isthmus."</p>

  <div class="footnotes">

  <p>The total deaths among employees of the Commission from yellow fever during the 12
  months October 1, 1904, to September 30, 1905, was 37, among about
  17,000.<sup>[30]</sup> The total from yellow fever among the whole population,
  including Canal employees, during the four months May 1 to August 31, 1905, was 47,
  while the number of deaths from malaria during the same period was 108. The effect of
  malaria in impairing physical efficiency was even more in excess than these figures
  indicate, for the fatal cases are a small proportion of the whole in malaria, and a
  very large proportion in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
  128]</a></span>yellow fever. The moral effect of the imminence of the more sudden and
  fatal form of disease was, however, as these reports show, much the greater, and it was
  this moral effect which caused the crisis above described.</p>

  <p>Previous to February, 1905, the Department of Sanitation had done little to improve
  the hygienic conditions of Colon and Panama, chiefly owing to the opinion until then
  maintained by the legal advisers that there was no authority to expend money in those
  cities, which are not within the Canal Zone.</p>

  <p>In April the yellow fever broke out; the number of men employed by the Department of
  Sanitation was increased to the huge total of 4,100, and the battle with yellow fever
  began in earnest. All cases were either transported to screened buildings, or, if left
  in their own homes, these were carefully screened with fine-meshed copper gauze. The
  object of this isolation was to prevent the patient from infecting healthy
  <i>stegomyia</i> mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>Every dwelling in Colon and Panama was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id=
  "Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>thoroughly fumigated with pyrethrum powder or with
  sulphur, and then cleared of dust and refuse, which, with the insensible but not always
  dead mosquitoes, was then burnt. The complete, and, it is hoped, final freedom from
  yellow fever in Colon and Panama has been obtained by means of a proper water supply
  and universal paving with brick or cement, as well as the supply of proper drainage.
  Formerly water for domestic use was stored in cisterns, tanks, tubs, jars, and so
  forth, and, after rain, water stood stagnantly in a thousand ruts and holes in the
  unpaved squares, streets, and lanes. These breeding-places of the <i>stegomyia</i> have
  now been done away with completely in Panama, and almost completely in Colon. The
  latter city is so low-lying and flat, and subject to such heavy rainfall, that pools of
  stagnant water will form. They can, however, be oiled, which kills the larv&aelig;,
  and, moreover, it is Panama, and not the wind-swept, salt-saturated, town of Colon,
  which has been the chief source of yellow fever.</p>

  <p>The last case of the disease in Panama <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
  "Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>occurred in November, 1905, and in May, 1906, there was
  an isolated case in Colon. The infection is considered to be at an end in a city three
  months after the last case, that being the lifetime of <i>stegomyia</i>. After this
  period, all infected <i>stegomyia</i> having died, those that remain are powerless for
  harm. Nevertheless, the stringent measures for their destruction are not relaxed, as,
  while <i>stegomyia</i> exists, the germ, if re-introduced, will be rapidly
  disseminated.</p>

  <p>Thus the yellow fever, having taken toll for four hundred years of those who crossed
  the Isthmus, has been completely eradicated by. Colonel Gorgas and his assistants. It
  is a triumph of science and of despotic government combined; and only in this
  combination can preventive medicine achieve full success.</p>

  <p>There is one other aspect of the yellow fever campaign which must be mentioned
  before going on to describe the fight with malaria.</p>

  <p>Yellow fever, unlike malaria, does not occur in all tropical countries. Its home is
  the West Indies, Central, and parts of South, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131"
  id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>America, and, before its extinction in Havana, it has
  been a serious scourge in the Southern United States. In the New World cases have
  occurred as far north as Quebec, in Europe cases have occurred in Wales and France, and
  there have been serious epidemics in Spain. It has never been known east of Genoa,
  whether in Europe or elsewhere. Thus in Africa it is known on the west but not on the
  east coast. The fact that it is unknown in India is very remarkable, seeing that
  <i>stegomyia</i> is a very prevalent variety of mosquito there. It follows from this
  that if yellow fever once got hold in India it would probably spread and might work
  great havoc. The same is true of China in an even greater degree, for such preventive
  measures as have been taken in Panama would be far more difficult to carry out in the
  great cities of India, and altogether impracticable in those of China. Thus, as Colonel
  Gorgas has pointed out, if the Canal had been constructed in spite of yellow fever, and
  if that disease had been allowed then to persist at Panama, the disease might not
  improbably <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg
  132]</a></span>have been carried to Asia, for the three months of life of
  <i>stegomyia</i> is ample for the voyage. In this event the Panama Canal might have
  proved a curse rather than a boon to mankind.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="c11">Malaria.</p>

  <p>The campaign against malaria has been conducted on somewhat different lines. The
  <i>anopheles</i>, which transmits that disease, deposits its larv&aelig; in clean water
  where grass and alg&aelig; grow, and is therefore almost entirely a mosquito of country
  districts. But Colon and Panama, both small cities, are exposed to the disease, as are
  about seventeen little towns and forty villages for labourers along the line of the
  Canal. As the flight of <i>anopheles</i> is not more than one hundred, or possibly two
  hundred yards, the working population can be in great measure protected from their
  attack by destroying the breeding places for such a distance on either side of the
  dwelling and working places. This in itself is a large task, which could not be carried
  out in a short time, and while in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
  "Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>progress the Sanitary Department relied mainly upon the
  erection of buildings completely screened (including the verandahs) with fine copper
  gauze, which effectually shields the employees against mosquito attack within doors,
  and therefore during the particularly dangerous hours of night.</p>

  <p>In addition, the employees are supplied with quinine, and recommended to take three
  grains daily while in health. This "cinchonises" the blood and renders it unwholesome
  to the malarial parasite.</p>

  <p>The effect of screening is shown by the following example from the report of the
  Commission, December, 1906:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The first shipload [of European labourers] arrived during the dry season, when
  mosquitoes were most scarce, and were quartered in unscreened buildings. Within six
  weeks of their arrival 33 per cent. of these labourers had been taken sick with
  malaria. The second shipload arrived during the rainy season, and were quartered in a
  camp not 200 yards distant from that of their predecessors. The buildings of the camp
  were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg
  134]</a></span>screened. Sickness among the men was infrequent, and when they had been
  upon the Isthmus six weeks it was found that only 4 per cent. had found their way to
  the hospitals."</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>The destruction of larv&aelig;, and of their hiding places, is commenced by the
  clearing of grass and bushes, which are cut down with the <i>machete</i>, a short
  cutlass with which the Panamanian is very expert, <i>machete</i> work being, indeed,
  the principal <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in which the Panamanian is employed by the Commission.
  Also ditches are cleaned out, and heavy oil poured upon the water in trenches and
  pools, and land-crabs are caught and the holes in which they dwell are filled in or
  oiled. Finally the soil is drained, which is the only means of making the ground
  permanently unfit for mosquito breeding. Subsoil draining is the best, a tile drain
  being put in; for, even in concreted gutters, pools will form, owing to accidental
  obstruction, and remain sufficiently long for the deposition and hatching of the
  larv&aelig;. Such is the work of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
  "Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><i>anopheles</i> brigade, and the <i>stegomyia</i>
  brigade carry out similar operations, in the neighbourhood more particularly of
  Panama.</p>

  <p>With regard to the effect of these operations upon the numbers of the mosquitoes I
  may narrate my own experience. I arrived at Colon first in January, 1907, and spent one
  or two nights on board my ship. This was two years and a half after the commencement of
  the mosquito campaign, and the officers of the ship congratulated themselves upon the
  absence of the swarms of mosquitoes which formerly attacked them at night on their
  vessel. I found, however, that although there was no swarm of mosquitoes, such as I
  have seen, <i>e.g.</i>, when on board ship in the harbour of Colombo, Ceylon, yet that
  the individuals who remained certainly caused me discomfort, and I think some
  subsequent indisposition. In April, 1908, however, during two days at Colon, I did not
  so much as see a single mosquito.</p>

  <p>At Panama, in January, 1907, my wife and I stayed in the Commission's screened hotel
  on Ancon Hill, not caring to face the dirt <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id=
  "Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>and squalor of the old city. In April, 1908, finding the
  city properly paved, drained, and plumbed, we took up our quarters at the Hotel Central
  in the town, where we spent a fortnight in perfect health; and although this building,
  not being under the Commission, is unscreened, I was only bitten by mosquitoes, to my
  knowledge, twice during that time, and this without subsequent ill effect. I may add
  that the picturesque surroundings, not unlike those of some city on the Mediterranean,
  greatly enhance the pleasure of a stay on the Isthmus, now that they can be enjoyed
  without squalid accompaniments. I did not, except on one or two nights, even draw the
  mosquito curtains. Out of doors, in the city of Panama, I was not bitten once, though I
  was attacked once or twice by solitary mosquitoes when walking on roads or paths with
  shrub or jungle adjoining. This was near the end of the dry season. When the rains
  commence a greater number of mosquitoes must be expected.</p>

  <p>Natives of the Isthmus and the West Indies are not immune from malaria, and in
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>1904-5 about
  one-half of the inhabitants who were examined proved to have the parasite of malaria in
  their blood. As the <i>anopheles</i> becomes infectious through biting a malarious man,
  it is evident that such a dissemination of the parasite throughout the blood of the
  human population renders mosquitoes especially dangerous. In the same proportion as the
  population becomes less malarious, so the mosquitoes become less dangerous, and
  theoretically a millennium is possible in which man and <i>anopheles</i>, mutually
  purged of the malarial organism, may live happily together. Unfortunately, a malarious
  man it is believed remains infectious to <i>anopheles</i> for no less than three years,
  instead of the three days' limit of yellow fever, and this greatly increases the
  difficulty of exterminating malaria.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

  <p>During 1906, with a force of 26,000, there were 21,739 cases of malaria admitted to
  the Commission Hospitals, and the death-rate from this disease was among whites 2 per
  thousand, among negroes 8 per thousand.</p>

  <p>In 1907, with a force of 39,000, there were 16,753 cases, the death-rate among
  whites being 3 per thousand and among negroes 4 per thousand. The increase among whites
  was due to the greater proportion of the European labourers, whose circumstances are
  different from those of the skilled artisans and the "screened" clerical staff of
  Americans.</p>

  <p>The total death-rate from all causes in 1907 is shown below:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&mdash;but accidents account for a considerable proportion of the deaths.</p>

  <p>During the same period the average number of American women and children in
  Commission quarters was 1,337, among whom occurred nine deaths, an average annual
  death-rate of 6.73 per thousand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id=
  "Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

  <p>In addition to malaria there is one other disease which proves fatal to considerable
  numbers of employees, attacking principally the black labourers. This is pneumonia, to
  which are attributed altogether 328 deaths as against 154 from malaria.</p>

  <p>It appears that special research is needed into the cause and prevention of this
  disease among negroes in the tropics.</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>In 1907 no less than 71,000 persons arrived on the Isthmus, all of whom had to pass
  the Commission doctor at the entrance port. All but transients are vaccinated on
  arrival, and great watchfulness is exercised against the introduction of any new
  disease from abroad. Thus, when bubonic plague broke out at Guayaquil, the Department
  of Sanitation commenced a campaign against rats as a precaution against the spread of
  the disease (which is propagated by the rat flea) in case quarantine measures failed to
  keep it out.</p>

  <p>Again, when one or two cases of rabies recently occurred on the Isthmus, all dogs
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>for whom an
  owner could not be found were at once destroyed.</p>

  <p class="c11">Life on the Isthmus, and on the Future of the White Man in the

  <p>The Canal Zone now being healthy, the life of the Americans is a cheerful as well as
  a busy one. The climate, to which the local diseases used to be attributed, is not by
  any means wholly bad. There are really two climates, that of the Atlantic seaboard and
  that of the Pacific side. Colon is somewhat trying on account of the humidity, but a
  healthy trade-wind blows. The town of Panama, though receiving much less rain, is also
  somewhat humid, owing to there being less breeze. The temperature, however, is lower
  than that of the great cities of the United States, even in the North, during summer
  heat-waves, the hours of sunshine are shorter, and the general feeling of oppression
  is, I think, distinctly less. The Ancon suburb, where the Commission buildings are
  situate, is free from the humidity of the low-lying city. The high lands at or near
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Culebra,
  where a large part of the American population now resides in screened wooden buildings,
  enjoy in the dry season a bracing climate, a fresh dry wind blowing across the divide,
  imparting a sense of exhilaration, which is heightened by the fine scenery, the
  pleasant scents of the surrounding woodland, and the ordered activity of the life.
  Amidst such circumstances the Canal official finds it easy to work hard. I noticed in
  this a great contrast to the condition ten years ago at Ismailia, the headquarters of
  the Suez Canal Administration. This place, before Major E. Ross's discoveries, suffered
  severely from malaria, and the officials of the Administration, some of whom had
  resided there for twenty years or more, were in many cases saturated with malarial
  poison. Work for them was a burden, bravely borne indeed, but taken up each day with a
  sigh. I spent about a fortnight there in a hot season conducting some investigations
  upon the forms and movement of drifting sand-dunes. I suffered during part of the time
  from fever, and only kept on working with an effort, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>whereas on the Isthmus I enjoyed more than
  usual vigour. At Culebra, indeed, the dry season is so bracing that the arrival of the
  rains is welcome for the soothing effect of greater humidity, as well as on account of
  diminished dust. The white woolly cloud or mist which then wraps round the hill-tops is
  no longer the "white death," as it was called in the days of the French Company, when
  the vapours were credited the poison which really lurks in the mosquito. Even now,
  however, there is an increase in the number of mosquitoes, and some increase in
  malaria, when the rains come.</p>

  have the same appearance as in the United States; perfectly dressed, as always, quiet
  in manner, and apparently happy, though occasionally somewhat bored. To the wife, not
  having the absorbing interest of the Canal work, the Isthmus is generally less
  interesting than to her husband, but of late there have grown up organisations for
  promoting intellectual and other social inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143"

  rare on the Isthmus; they are bronzed, active, fearless in bearing, and apparently
  thoroughly satisfied with themselves and with their surroundings. Even when within
  doors they are still in a sense in the open air, for the windows are unglazed, and the
  houses are constructed so as to secure a free circulation of air.</p>

  <p>It has been said that the possession of India taught the English the value of the
  cold bath, an institution which has been slowly adopted from us by other Northern
  nations in Europe. Perhaps the possession of the Canal Zone will lead to the salutary
  open-window habit, which is not yet general in the United States.</p>

  <p>The Commission clubs for gold-employees at the principal stations are commodious
  structures, admirably designed for social <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
  "Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>recreation; their management is entrusted to the Young
  Men's Christian Association. There are well-equipped reading and writing rooms and
  gymnasia, mainly used by the men, but the interests of the women and children are not
  neglected, and for the last playrooms are provided. The large halls are used for
  entertainments and for meetings of the numerous benevolent "secret" societies which
  have been so important a factor in the preliminary organisation of American society in
  newly settled territories. In the clubs only "soft" drinks are provided, but I can
  testify to their excellent effects.</p>

  <p>The question whether the white race can make a home in the tropics depends
  ultimately upon the tropical baby&mdash;upon his own health and that of his mother. The
  American occupation is still recent, but as far as experience goes it seems that the
  white children born on the Isthmus have not shown unusual delicacy, and the mothers
  have made a normal, though sometimes rather slow, recovery from confinement.</p>

  <p>The views of Colonel Gorgas upon the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id=
  "Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>future of the white race in the tropics deserve
  quotation. He writes<sup>[31]</sup>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I think the sanitarian can now show that any population coming into the tropics can
  protect itself against these two diseases [malaria and yellow fever] by measures that
  are both simple and inexpensive; that with these two diseases eliminated life in the
  tropics for the Anglo-Saxon will be more healthful than in the temperate zones; that
  gradually, within the next two or three centuries, tropical countries, which offer a
  much greater return for man's labour than do the temperate zones, will be settled up by
  the white races, and that again the centres of wealth, civilisation and population will
  be in the tropics, as they were in the dawn of man's history, rather than in the
  temperate zone, as at present."</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[31]</sup> "Sanitation in the Canal Zone."</p>
  </div>

  <p>In this connection I may perhaps be permitted to refer to an interesting suggestion
  made in the course of conversation by Colonel Gorgas, although I omitted to inquire if
  it had been published. This suggestion was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id=
  "Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>that the records of the movements of great armies under
  the rulers of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt indicate that malaria did not then exist in
  the nearer East, and that malaria, like yellow fever, was once a local disease.</p>

  </div>

  <p>From what I have seen as tourist and traveller (not as resident) in the West Indies
  and in the Orient, I have arrived at the following tentative conclusions,
  viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p>That the debilitating effect which the tropics have been observed to exercise upon
  those who come from temperate regions has been due mainly to the presence of certain
  diseases which can be done away with.</p>

  <p>That the rapid deterioration of the white stock which is usually noticed in the
  tropics, especially near the equator, is mainly due to the same cause.</p>

  <p>But that Anglo-Saxons cannot perform nearly the same amount of hard bodily labour in
  a constantly hot climate as they can in the temperate zone, and Anglo-Saxon immigrants
  never will be able to do so. In this I think the Mediterranean races&mdash;at all
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>events the
  Spaniards and Italians&mdash;are our superiors.</p>

  <p>Whether the descendants of Anglo-Saxon stock who have settled in a tropical country
  purified from tropical diseases will be able to support continued hard bodily labour
  better than their immigrant ancestors is a matter about which we have at present no
  direct evidence.</p>

  <p>It may possibly be worth noting, however, that some years ago, when wintering in
  Manitoba, I found that some of the farmer immigrants from England felt the cold more as
  the years went by, but that their children born in the country were unaffected by
  it.</p>

  <p>It is the case that in the tropics, particularly in the equable equatorial belt,
  many evils of the temperate zone are avoided, chiefly those due to cold and to sudden
  changes of temperature. It is this equatorial belt of equable temperature and heavy
  rainfall that I chiefly have in mind, for it comprises those vast regions of prolific
  vegetation which appear capable of supporting so large a population.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

  <p>The white man already rules, or has marked off for rule, the whole of the equatorial
  belt, but who is to be the peasant cultivating this belt? In those parts of tropical
  Asia already peopled by industrious Orientals there can never be a white peasantry.
  Equatorial Africa presents great differences in different parts with respect to native
  population, and the question of a possible future for white peasantry is there a
  complicated one. In South America, however, there are vast equatorial regions either
  wholly unpeopled, or sparsely inhabited by tribes of that Indian stock which has
  elsewhere proved so slight an impediment to the establishment of the white labourer.
  Served by a system of rivers unrivalled elsewhere in equatorial regions, already
  partitioned among Christian Governments, and for the most part uninhabited, the forests
  and savannahs of Equatorial South America offer the readiest field for the
  establishment on a vast scale of a white peasantry under the equator.</p>

  <p>By clearing the scrub within one or two hundred yards of his cottage, and by
  em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ploying
  wire screens, the cultivator can protect himself against malaria, and his crops come
  not once, but several times a year.</p>

  <p>If the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian peasant were to turn his attention to this
  field, instead of, or in addition to, that of navvy work, great things might come of
  it. The circumstance that South America is a Roman Catholic continent, where the Latin
  races are dominant, would enormously favour the experiment. On the Zone, the Spanish
  labourer works in order to save and to depart, the <i>milieu</i> being foreign to him
  and unattractive. In a Latin State it would be different.</p>

  <p>In writing of the possibilities of the white race in the equatorial zone it is
  understood that the problem relates to the lowlands. There are, of course, favoured
  highlands, such as those of Colombia, where the temperature is at the same time
  moderate and equable and the climate appears admirably adapted to white men.</p>

  <p>A healthy city life in the tropics would be easily attainable in a new country
  settled <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg
  150]</a></span>wholly by white people and under a medical despotism.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

  <p>The general, but non-specialist, opinion upon the Isthmus is not as sanguine as that
  of Colonel Gorgas upon the hygienic future of the white race in the tropics. The
  general opinion among Americans seems to be that, as far as they are concerned, they
  would, if engaged in the tropical parts of South or Central America, avail themselves
  of the improving means of transit to revisit frequently the United States, and would
  rely upon such vacations in higher latitudes for the retention of their native
  vigour.</p>

  <h5>ON THE SHORTENING OF DISTANCES BY SEA, AND ON THE STEAMSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR CANAL
  TRANSIT</h5>

  <p class="c11">The Shortening of Distances by Sea.</p>

  <p class="introduction"><span class="first-letter">A</span>S the sole object of a ship
  canal is to shorten sea distances, the figures given in this section are of primary
  importance to a proper understanding of the subject. The figures here given are those
  for steamships following the actual or prospective routes. They are adopted from the
  figures supplied to the Canal Commission from the United States Hydrographic Bureau and
  are expressed in nautical miles. It is perhaps not wholly superfluous to warn the
  reader that the apparent relative distances as shown on charts of the world, especially
  those on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg
  154]</a></span>usual Mercator projection, are very different from the real relative
  distances. Moreover, it is impossible to see correctly the relative distances between
  places far apart on a globe, for the foreshortening of the rounded surface produces
  distortion. By applying a measuring tape to the globe the true relative distances can
  be readily ascertained. This is a salutary exercise and serves to correct the erroneous
  notions which tend to fix themselves in the minds of all of us owing to the appearance
  of the surface of the globe on the plane of the paper or on the plane of vision. Such a
  measurement of shortest distances would give a very fair notion of the actual
  reductions due to the Suez and Panama Canals, but there would still be considerable
  differences between these figures and the distance calculated from the actual courses
  pursued by steamships, which in what follows will be referred to simply as "the"
  distance between ports.</p>

  <p>The most notable effect of the Panama Canal will be the reduction of distance
  between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of North <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>America. Taking New York as our port of
  reckoning on the Atlantic, the distance thence to Panama and all ports north thereof on
  the Pacific seaboard of Central and North America will be reduced by 8,415 miles.</p>

  <p>The reduction of distance from New York to the Pacific ports of South America, on
  the other hand, is not constant, but varies from the above maximum of 8,415 miles at
  Panama to a minimum of about 1,004 miles at Punta Arenas (in the Straits of Magellan).
  The <i>average</i> shortening on this coast is therefore</p>

  <p>The actual shortening to Iquique, the nitrate port in Chile, is 5,200 miles. We
  shall not be far out in saying briefly that the distance between New York and South
  American Pacific ports will be shortened by an average of 5,000 miles.</p>

  <p>The Canal shortens the distance between the Pacific coast of the Americas and the
  ports of Europe also, though in a lesser degree. Thus, taking Liverpool as our
  ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ample (and
  the reductions are much the same for London, Antwerp, or Hamburg), the Canal will
  shorten the distance to Panama and all ports on the coast to the north by a constant
  quantity, viz., 6,046 miles.</p>

  <p>The reduction to Pacific ports south of Panama is not a constant but a variable
  quantity, ranging from the above maximum of 6,046 miles at Panama itself to zero at a
  point between Punta Arenas and Coronel (the most southern industrial port of Chile). We
  may put the average shortening of distance between Liverpool and South American Pacific
  ports at about 2,600 miles.</p>

  <p>Viewing the whole matter from the standpoint of the Pacific ports of the Americas,
  we see an absolute commercial advantage accruing to them all in the diminished distance
  to the Atlantic and Gulf ports of North America and to the ports of Europe.</p>

  <p>Viewing the matter from the standpoint of the Atlantic and Gulf ports of North
  America&mdash;to fix our ideas we will say from the standpoint of New York&mdash;we see
  the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>same
  absolute advantage <i>plus</i> a competitive advantage, in that the reduction is
  greater for New York than for Liverpool (<i>i.e.</i>, Europe).</p>

  <p>As the world is at present constituted, steamers from New York and from Liverpool
  proceeding to these Pacific ports all pass Pernambuco, in Brazil, near the easternmost
  point of South America, not far south of the equator. This port is 4,066 miles from
  Liverpool and 3,696 miles from New York, so that, by sea, San Francisco is only 370
  miles nearer to New York than to Liverpool. But Colon is 4,720 miles from Liverpool and
  only 1,961 from New York, so that <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Canal all the Pacific ports of
  the Americas are 2,759 miles nearer to New York than to Liverpool.</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>Let us next consider the Canal as the starting place for Transpacific voyages, the
  <i>r&ocirc;le</i> for which it was originally projected in the sixteenth century. In
  those days the Isthmus of Suez was firmly held by the hostile Moslem, and even if a
  canal had then been open there, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id=
  "Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>it would not have been available for the commerce of
  Christian Europe. Thus the discovery of a strait, or the cutting of a canal, at the
  Isthmus of Panama would at that time have opened to Europeans a shorter seaway to the
  Orient. But now that the Suez route has been opened for ships, the <i>Panama Canal will
  not bring any port in Australia or the East Indies, nor any ice-free port in Asia or
  Asiatic Islands, nearer to any European port</i>. Of all ports on the west, that is to
  say the Old World or "Oriental" side, of the Pacific, only those of New Zealand and
  some in Siberia will be brought nearer to Liverpool, and that to an insignificant
  amount.</p>

  <p>Ports on the mainland of Asia in these latitudes are of course nearer to New York by
  way of Suez.</p>

  <p>The opportunities of a port for commerce obviously depend in a great measure upon
  the centrality of its position with reference to the other ports of the world. Let us
  see how Liverpool and New York were originally situated in this respect, and how far
  their situations are altered first by the opening of the Suez route and secondly by
  that of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
  160]</a></span>Panama; remembering also that the changes introduced by the canals have
  about the same effect on Antwerp or Hamburg as on Liverpool.</p>

  <p>Prior to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 the route to Asia and Australia was
  <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Cape of Good Hope from both Liverpool and New York. This gave
  Liverpool an advantage of 480 miles for all Asiatic and Australian ports as well as for
  the East Coast of Africa. For most of South America and all the Pacific coast of the
  Americas the route was <i>vi&acirc;</i> Pernambuco, and New York had an advantage of
  370 miles.</p>

  <p>Suez being open but Panama still closed, the route to Asia is <i>vi&acirc;</i>
  Gibraltar for both Liverpool and New York. New York is distant 3,207 miles and
  Liverpool 1,283 from that place, so that Liverpool has an advantage of 1,924 miles
  instead of 480 on the voyage to all Asiatic ports, a competitive benefit of 1,444 miles
  resulting from the opening of the Suez Canal.</p>

  <p>The voyage to Australia from New York being still made <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Cape of
  Good Hope, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg
  161]</a></span>while that from Liverpool is most shortly made by Suez, Liverpool is
  1,622 miles nearer by the canal and 480 by the Cape, thus obtaining a benefit of 1,142
  miles when the Suez route is taken.</p>

  <p>The opening of the Panama route leaves unchanged the relative distances to the
  Atlantic coast of South America, to Africa, and to Asiatic ports south of Shanghai; but
  it is New York and not Liverpool which is now the nearer port to Yokohama, Sydney, and
  Melbourne; and Wellington, New Zealand, formerly nearly equidistant, is placed 2,739
  miles nearer to New York than to Liverpool.</p>

  <p>With reference to Northern China, however, it is to be noted that, although the
  Panama route shortens the distance between New York and Shanghai by 1,629 miles,
  Liverpool will still be the nearer to Shanghai by 295 miles, assuming the New York
  vessel to call at San Francisco.</p>

  relation to Canal trade. Let us take the standpoint, not of Europe or of America, but
  of traders residing in this area. Near its western margin the Suez and the Panama
  routes to New York are equal in length.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id=
  "Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

  <p>Near its eastern margin, which lies, however, outside Japan and Australia and only
  passes among small islands, the Suez and Panama routes to Liverpool are of equal
  length.</p>

  <p>On a line rather west of the centre and running from rather west of north to rather
  east of south, all places are equidistant from New York and Liverpool&mdash;the latter
  <i>vi&acirc;</i> Suez, the former <i>vi&acirc;</i> Panama.</p>

  <p>It needs no prophet to foresee interesting commercial developments in a region where
  the alternative routes and alternative sources of manufacturing supply offer almost
  equal allurements.</p>

  <p>I must also draw attention to the position of New Orleans and other ports on the
  Gulf of Mexico in relation to the Canal. At present New Orleans by sea is further than
  New York from Valparaiso and San Francisco, Yokohama and Shanghai, but it is 581 miles
  nearer to Colon. Hence, when the Panama Canal is open it will be 581 miles nearer than
  New York to those ports, and to Sydney, Melbourne, and Wellington. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Thus, as the Mississippi
  waterway is improved, an increasing proportion of the manufactures and other products
  of the great Mississippi basin will find their way to foreign markets <i>vi&acirc;</i>
  the Gulf ports, and an increasing proportion of imports will find their way to the
  Mississippi basin through these ports.<sup>[33]</sup></p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[33]</sup> Among West Indian ports affected by the Canal, Kingston, Jamaica,
    must be particularly mentioned. Now situate at the entrance of a <i>cul de sac</i>,
    it will then be placed in a position of much greater centrality for the world's
    commerce, and astride the route from Colon to the North American Atlantic ports. Thus
    the importance of Jamaica as a constituent of the British Empire will be enhanced.
    May the opening of the Canal increase the prosperity of our fellow subjects who have
    suffered so greatly from hurricane and earthquake!</p>
  </div>

  <p>In dealing with the shortening of sea routes it was shown that the greatest
  reduction was that between the two coasts of North America, but even so the sea route
  remains longer than that by land, so that the question of commercial advantage is not
  settled by a mere statement of sea distances, and the indisputable and undiluted
  advantages of the Canal route for the Atlantic and Gulf <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ports of North America are those of
  commerce with the Pacific coast of South America, with New Zealand, Australia, Japan,
  Northern China, Manchuria, and Eastern Siberia.</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>From the naval point of view, however, the results of shortening the sea distance
  from New York to San Francisco are scarcely diminished by the fact of railway
  communication, since only crews and stores, and not warships, can be transported by
  rail.</p>

  <p>In order to understand the effect of the Canal upon the naval position of the United
  States the student of affairs must, in addition to the information given above, examine
  the positions relatively to the Canal of the possessions, particularly the insular
  possessions, of the United States and of other naval Powers. This will enable him to
  gauge for himself the more permanent factors which determine the value of the new line
  of communication, the opportunities it affords for concentrating force where wanted,
  and the responsibilities of defence which it entails. With the aid of a fairly good
  atlas this can <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg
  166]</a></span>easily be done by anyone acquainted with the general facts of naval
  power at the present time. The geographical facts, which are perhaps the only ones
  beyond question or dispute, are sufficiently simple.</p>

  <p class="c11">On the Steamships Available for Canal Transit.</p>

  <p>The Isthmian Canal Commission, in the Report of 1899, distinguishes between the
  commercial and the industrial benefits of the Canal, meaning by the former term the
  increased carrying of goods, and by the latter the development of production induced by
  improved facilities of carriage.</p>

  <p>The tables of distances already given show the <i>potential</i> commercial
  advantages, and how they are distributed in different measure among different
  countries, and these figures have all the permanence which makes geographical figures
  of such enduring importance.</p>

  <p>But the actual commercial advantage of a ship canal depends equally upon a second
  factor, viz., the available ship-tonnage. Supposing a Panama Canal to be open at
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>the present
  time, there would be hardly any United States ships to use it, except in transport
  between home ports from which ships flying foreign flags are debarred. The transport to
  South America, New Zealand, Australia, Northern China, and Japan would necessarily be
  almost wholly carried on by ships of other nations, especially British.</p>

  <p>The absence of an American merchant marine trading with foreign ports is indeed a
  circumstance without parallel among other nations engaged in modern manufacture. Many
  interesting facts relating to this strange phenomenon were put on record in the debates
  of the United States Senate in the early part of 1908.<sup>[34]</sup></p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[34]</sup> <i>Congressional Record</i>, February 24, 1908.</p>
  </div>

  <p>At that time there was not one steamship flying the flag of the United States
  between her ports and those of Brazil, the Argentine, Chile, or Peru.</p>

  <p>The three steamships of the Oceanic Line formerly plying to Australia were then laid
  up in the harbour of San Francisco, being unable, although subsidised for mails by
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>the United
  States Government, to compete with foreign vessels. There were, however, three United
  States steamers plying from Puget Sound to Japan and China, occasionally reaching the
  Philippines.</p>

  <p>The mails from New York and the other Atlantic ports of the United States to Brazil
  and the Argentine go <i>vi&acirc;</i> Europe, so that in this important matter New York
  is actually 3,000 miles further than Europe, instead of being 370 miles nearer to those
  countries.<sup>[35]</sup></p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <p><sup>[35]</sup> Senator Gallinger, <i>loc. cit.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>In the same debate Senator Depew said that ships receiving the United States mail
  subsidy, the only form of subsidy given, have to be American built, manned by
  Americans, and the diet of the sailors as prescribed by law. He added that&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The labour unions have rightly and properly taken care of their wages. The result
  is that the cost in wages and food to run American ships under American conditions
  across the Pacific is double that of European or Japanese steamers."</p>

  <p>The relative cost of operating American <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id=
  "Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>and European vessels was given by the Hon. Elihu Root,
  Secretary of State, in an address delivered November 30, 1906,<sup>[36]</sup> as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The operation of an American steamship of 2,500 tons costs $18,289 per annum more
  than that of a British ship of this tonnage, or $7.31 more per ton; and</p>

  <p>The operation of an American steamship of 3,500 tons costs $15,315 per annum more
  than that of a German ship of the same size, or $4.37 more per ton.</p>

    by Mr. Root and published <i>Nat. Geogr. Mag.</i>, 1907, vol. xviii. pp. 61-72.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus it is evident that, in spite of geographical advantages, there are at present
  some grounds for the extreme opinion sometimes expressed in the United States that the
  Canal is being built with American money for the use of Europe&mdash;and, one may add,
  of Japan.</p>

  <p>What attempts may be made to remedy this state of things, and what effects such
  attempts may have, are matters on which I shall not stay to speculate.</p>

  <p class="introduction"><span class="first-letter">O</span>F the existing canals for
  ocean-going ships, that of Suez was built by a company as a commercial undertaking to

  <p>The Manchester Ship Canal was partly commercial, partly industrial, <i>i.e.</i>, the
  large contribution of the city of Manchester was made not as a financial speculation,
  but in order to promote an undertaking likely to develop the industries of the city.
  This canal, partly commercial, partly industrial, cost $75,000,000.</p>

  <p>The Kiel Canal has further a military purpose, providing a short line of
  communication for warships. It cost $40,000,000. The Panama Canal is commercial,
  industrial, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg

      <td>Total</td>

      <td><span class="overline">126,047,062</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The amount authorised to be appropriated by the Act of June 28, 1902, was
  $135,000,000, plus $50,000,000 purchase money, that is to say, $185,000,000 in all, for
  "the canal, harbours, and defences."</p>

  <p>What the total cost will be is unknown, but Colonel Goethals stated in evidence
  (January, 1908) that the Canal would cost at least $250,000,000, and possibly as much
  as $500,000,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
  175]</a></span></p>

  <p>The combined cost of the Suez, Manchester, and Kiel Canals has been
  $205,000,000.</p>

  <p>The following important ship canals have been completed for smaller sums:&mdash;</p>

  <table width="80%" summary="ships">
    <tr>
      <td>U.S.S. St. Marie (somewhat more than)</td>

      <td>Total</td>

      <td><span class="overline">59,000,000</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Adding these figures to those already given, we have a grand total of $264,000,000
  for the cost of nine of the greatest existing ship canals, which is about the same as
  the lowest current official estimate for the final cost of the Panama Canal.</p>

  <p>In the case of a commercial company undertaking such a work as the Panama Canal, the
  charge for compounded interest increases as the unremunerative years <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>advance at an appalling
  rate, which would surprise anyone not versed in the cumulative capability of figures
  which increase in "geometrical progression."</p>

  <p>Fortunately it is not necessary for the United States to reckon the cost of the
  Canal in this way, and the Government have been in a peculiarly advantageous position
  for financing the Canal.</p>

  <p>The bonds bear interest at 2 per cent., and in December, 1907, were slightly above
  103. As all American banks have to deposit gold with the United States Treasury it
  evidently pays to take up and deposit these bonds, which reckon as gold, receiving 2
  per cent. interest.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the small amount of securities with Government guarantee in America
  renders such issues convenient, so that the Government can raise money more cheaply
  than with us, although for industrial purposes the rates may be higher.</p>

  <p>At the present time the payments of Government pensions in connection with the Civil
  War are yearly diminishing at a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id=
  "Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>rapid rate. Finally, there has been in the Treasury a
  large surplus of cash. Thus from one cause and another the expenditure already incurred
  has not yet been felt.</p>
  <hr class='c6' />

  <p>As I write the last lines of the account in which I have endeavoured to state the
  salient facts relating to a great undertaking at only moderate length, I recall our
  departure from Colon harbour on the R.M.S. <i>Orinoco</i> homeward bound. I confess
  that after the Canal Zone most places seem only half alive, and I long to be back where
  one can watch human activities so great and so intelligent, while the spirit is soothed
  by the balmy air which blows warm and fragrant from the tropical forest.</p>

  <p>May the arduous labours of the Isthmian Canal Commission be crowned with
  success!</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
